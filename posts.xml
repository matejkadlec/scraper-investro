<Title>What is Polkadot?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h3>Pokladot made simple</h3>
<p>To put in very simple words, Polkadot is a network protocol that allows any data (not just tokens as is a standard in the sector) to be moved between blockchains. Polkadot enables the transfer of this data and information not only on public, open blockchains, but also on private blockchains.
The focus of Polkadot is to find solutions to problems related to interoperability (the ability of different blockchains to work together) and scalability. These are the two most common and also the most difficult solutions to blockchain platforms and therefore finding a unique solution to them would give a huge advantage to the hands of the project being able to do so.</p>
<h3>History</h3>
<p>Although Polkadot did not earn attention until the year 2020, the whitepaper for this cryptocurrency was released back in October 2016. This project was founded by Dr. Gavin Wood, who is one of the most influential developers in the world of cryptocurrencies. In addition to being part of the team that developed Ethereum and the its programming language, Solidity, Gavin Woods also founded the blockchain company Parity Technologies. Together with another developer, Peter Czaban, they were behind the creation of the Swiss non-profit Web 3.0 foundation, which is helping with the development of Polkadot.</p>
<p>It was this company (Web 3.0 foundation) that also organized the ICO for Polkadot in 2017, when they managed to raise more than $ 140 million. This was one of the largest ICOs to date, selling 50% of all tokens from then total supply of 10 million DOT tokens. Just after the ICO, however, came the biggest misdemeanour, when Parity and Polkadot managed to lose more than 66% of all funds raised from the ICO process (approximately $ 90 million). For most of the projects, this would mean an immediate ending, however, the story of Polkadot continued.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the project, they were able to offset the loss and continue their development. This was also due to the help of 2 more investment rounds that followed. Both were held privately, the first in 2019 and the second in July of 2020. For the second investment round, Polkadot managed to raise more than $ 43 million. This enabled the official launch of Polkadot, which took place only in mid-August of 2020, when there was the biggest uproar surrounding the cryptocurrency that has been continuing ever since.</p>
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>In addition to being one of the most promising DeFi projects, Polkadot is also one of the most complicated and complex in terms of technology. We will only briefly introduce the most important concepts you need to know about, if you are interested in Polkadot.
Polkadot is built on the Substrate Blockchain Framework, which was developed by Parity and is used by developers to create their own platforms and technological solutions. This is what allows blockchains to communicate with each other, provided that they are built on the Substrate network. Polkadot technology consists of three key concepts, which we will briefly introduce:</p>
<li>Relay Chain - is the heart of the entire Polkadot network. The main responsibility of this chain is security, consensus and cross-chain interoperability of the entire network.</li>
<li>Parachains - are separate blockchains within this network, which can have their own tokens and their functionality can change based on what the tokens and blockchains are to be used for.</li>
<li>Bridges - are systems that allow the communication of the entire network with external networks such as Ethereum or Bitcoin.</li>

<span class="img-caption">Sketch of Pokladot structure, Source: wiki.pokladot.network</span>
<p>The combinations of all of these three factors should solve interoperability problems. Scalability via sharded blockchains, on the other hand, will allow transactions on Polkadot network to be processed at once (multi-parallelized transactions), which means that they do not have to be executed one after the other, but rather several transactions at once.</p>
<p>The consensus of the entire network and its approval divides investors into 4 groups, each with a different role. Specifically, these are nominators, validators, collectors and fishermen. Each of these positions has a different function and rationale in the network. If you want to invest in the Polkadot project, we definitely recommend you to study the differences between them, as they form the core of the consensus and thus the functionality of the entire network.</p>
<h3>Forkless Upgrades</h3>
<p>In the case of Polkadot, the so-called "forkless upgrades" are one of the most significant technological changes that this project aims to bring to the crypto world. The lack of need for forks is provided through a special governance process, which is made possible by a transparent on-chain mechanism that is built directly into the Relay Chain.
It will allow participants to argue and vote on any decisions regarding the development of this cryptocurrency. In addition, each of the individual shards has the ability to modify and, if necessary, create their own governance voting system to suit the needs of a given blockchain or project, so that it will not be necessary to fork the entire network.</p>
<h3>Use of DOT Token</h3>
<p>DeFi projects are characterized by having their governance tokens to play a key role in building decentralized technologies. Although these tokens do not always perform a number of different functions, Polkadot with their DOT token is the best example of how many different uses a single token can have.</p>
<li>Staking - the DOT token must be held by different groups of investors if they want to be part of the network and decision-making. Similarly, to Proof-of-Stake systems, the more DOT tokens owned by specific entity, the greater the staking reward can be expected.</li>
<li>Fees - users will pay to validators in DOT tokens if they want to send messages to other parachains. For comparison, DOT will work similarly as Gas on the Ethereum network (similarly, not the same).</li>
<li>Bonding - the DOT token will also be used to create new parachains. In the event that users choose to create a new parachain, DOT tokens will be locked and will not be available for the owner until the parachain is discontinued or irrelevant.</li>
<li>Governance - as is often the case with staking, the holders of DOT token will be able to vote on a variety of decisions, including network fees, auction dynamics, protocol for parachains or improvements, and other improvements</li>

<span class="img-caption">Different use cases of DOT token, Source: coinbureau.com</span>
<p>If you are interested in the DOT token, you can get it on almost every leading cryptocurrency exchange. It can be bought, for example, on Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, Huobi or Bitfinex. If you decide to buy this token and keep it securely on your wallet and not on the stock exchange, the options are using Polkawallet or more secure off-line Ledger Nano X or Ledger Nano S wallets. At the time of writing the article, Trezor only offers Pokladot Futures (xDOT).</p>
<h3>Tokenomics</h3>
<p>The tokenomics of this cryptocurrency also underwent a very interesting development. Originally, this project had the supply of 10 million tokens (during the ICO). However, one of the first public votes on this network caused a 100-fold split. This decision was supported by up to 86% of all voters and meant that the total supply of DOT tokens increased from 10 million DOT to one billion DOT. During this time, the DOT token got listed on several leading exchanges, such as the Kraken. This step took place around the middle of August 2020, which is also the time when the price of this token started to be tracked. This means that the technical graph of this cryptocurrency does not reveal much yet.
However, it was this split and the voting associated with it, that not only confirmed the effectiveness of on-chain governance voting, but also facilitated the future use of the DOT token. What is interesting and important for the tokenomics of this cryptocurrency is to keep in mind that the overall supply of this cryptocurrency is dynamic, which means that it will change over time through inflation, which is supposed to increase the total supply.</p>
<h3>Pros and cons of Pokladot</h3>
<p>Polkadot is often described as "Ethereum Killer," which, however, is a sentiment connected to half of the projects in the cryptocurrency world. Nevertheless, Polkadot provides several extremely interesting technological innovations and solutions, which significantly differentiates this cryptocurrency from the competition. Moreover, Polkadot has a relatively long history, compared to other DeFi projects, and also has one of the most experienced teams in the crypto world. It also has the support of investors, who, despite the initial major mistake, which cost the project more than $ 90 million, still believe in the potential and technology of this cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>We have already partially mentioned the two biggest disadvantages of Polkadot in the previous paragraph. In addition to being just the "next killer of Ethereum," Polkadot may have trouble with extremely strong competition. In addition to well-known projects that already have a place in the cryptocurrency sector, such as Ethereum (ETH), Tezos (XTZ) or Cardano (ADA), competing projects include a number of new DeFi projects, which also have huge potential. These include projects such as Dfinity (IOU), Avalanche (AVAX) or Near Protocol (NEAR).</p>
<p>The disadvantage of this project is the fact that it managed to lose more than $ 90 million. This is not something that you can see in this sector every day. Although investors seem to have forgotten this misstep, they certainly have it in mind. Should such a mistake occur again, it can be said with almost certainty that the undermined credibility of the whole project, despite its great potential, would be completely buried. But as we have already mentioned, Polkadot certainly has something to offer, especially from a technological point of view, so one can only hope, that this will not happen.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Polkadot undoubtedly has great potential. It is one of the most promising DeFi projects connected to the crypto world, which has a great and experienced team. However, in order to succeed in tough competition, this project will not only have to avoid the mistakes they made during the ICO phase, but also confirm and implement the potential of their technologies, which will take time.</p>

<Excerpt>Polkadot is one of the miracles of the cryptocurrency world and its latest DeFi trend. Despite being on the scene since 2016, this DeFi (decentralized finance) project managed to gain significant attention from the crypto community only in 2020. Even though the investors have been looking at this project for long time, due to its exciting technologies and innovation, a major boom only occurred in the year 2020, when Pokladot finally showed its potential.</Excerpt>

<Title>Clubhouse Media Group Inc – CMGR</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Clubhouse Media Group Inc is a media and marketing company that runs content houses. It offers management, production, and deal-making services to its influencers, a management division for individual influencer clients, and an investment arm for joint ventures and acquisitions for companies in the social media influencer space. This company is trading in the OTC market only. CMGR is not fully reporting essential data for a potential investor. It's a typical tiny company with small market capitalization.</p>
<p>CMGR sales data look as follows:</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/1_b7d711e0db.png" alt="default">
<span class="img-caption">Source: gurufocus</span>
<strong>The speculative mania is here</strong>
<p>As there are no reliable data due today for the company, many of that reported in 2017 last time, we expect an excellent short opportunity is here. There is no real news behind the company (and stock price rise), any excellent guidance, or breakthrough discovery so that we could accept current valuations and current price. The stock has exploded after Elon Musk's portion of tweets about Clubhouse. He was talking about the Clubhouse app for communication. The speculators thought or traded this company by mistake. As there is excellent momentum, the more algo and even bigger speculators came into the game. However, there is no relation between CMGR and Clubhouse app. As all investors will realize, we guess the stock will fall sharply as it will lose momentum.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/2_8fe513d61a.png" alt="default">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Tradingview</span>
<p>As there is no fundamental narrative, we expect the stock will fall sharply in a few days/weeks. We saw similar scenarios in these stocks: SIGL (the same scenario with Musk), Gamestop, Koss, and other wallstreetbets's stocks they followed. This time, there is no support from wallstreetbets. The momentum from a very short term is solid, even strong, so that speculators could pull the price up. However, there is a significant probability from CMGR Board of Directors or maybe one-person-owner to offer stocks at this price to make himself a millionaire.</p>
<p><strong>We expect the same way will follow.</strong>

<Title>What is DeFi? </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Decentralized finance, known as DeFi, is beginning to attract more and more attention from companies involved in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This a relatively new term that has recently resonated with the crypto community, is however also gaining attention outside of crypto world. What is DeFi, what problems do they solve and what is the future of financial products without an intermediary? Let's describe it a little more extensively today for a greater understanding.</strong>
</p>
<h2>What is decentralized finance?</h2>
<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) can be described as a financial superstructure or upgrade of existing cryptocurrencies. With cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin or Ethereum, it is possible to receive, pay or save without the use of any intermediaries, the need to register or prove identity.However, this does not apply if one needs other financial services associated with cryptocurrencies: lending, leverage or hedging are still primarily the domain of centralized exchanges and other service providers, such as BitMex, Bakkt, or BlockFi.</p>
<p>The use of these services carries the risk of losing access to one's own resources; in some parts of the world, these services are also unavailable due to international sanctions. In short, centralized services and privacy, financial inclusion and self-management do not go hand in hand. One of the motivations for the development of Bitcoin was and is the effort to remove large financial institutions from monetary relations, which is what DeFi does.</p>
<h2>Decentralized finance vs. centralized finance</h2>
<p>Compared to centralized providers of crypto financial products (BitMex, Bakkt, etc.), decentralized finance differs in that they try to maintain the typical characteristics of cryptocurrencies in this area as well. These are in particular:</p>
<p><strong>a) Minimizing the need for trust -</strong>
 DeFi services do not keep user resources on non-transparent wallets, to which only service administrators would have access (as is the case with the largest cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, BitMEX or BitFinex). Users make deposits to the addresses of smart contracts with transparently defined conditions under which these funds can move. Typically, funds can only be handled by depositors and trading robots disposing of insufficiently secured accounts.</p>
<p><strong>b) Openness of code and data -</strong>
 DeFi projects have published source code (or at least the part defining the handling of resources) on GitHub or other platforms. Smart contracts deployed on the mainnet have known addresses on Etherscan. Due to the fact that the settlement of transactions takes place on-chain (on the public blockchain), fundamental economic data such as the number of users or the volume of invested and traded funds are public. Projects usually facilitate data analysis by publishing a documented API.</p>
<p><strong>c) Financial Inclusion -</strong>
 Current DeFi applications do not require any identification from users. Unlike cryptocurrency exchanges, where KYC (know your customer) processes are gradually becoming the norm, within DeFi the only necessary user identifier is the users Ether account, the individual services are then no longer registered, but only connected with a wallet (eg with the help of Web 3 interfaces such as Metamask). While within crypto exchanges such as Kraken, for example, people from 36 countries cannot trade bitcoin futures contracts, this financial exclusion does not take place within DeFi applications.</p>
<h2>Guaranteed and secured loans: the building block of decentralized finance</h2>
<p>One of the accompanying characteristics of cryptocurrencies is that they do not need the concept of identity and trust to function satisfactorily. Therefore, the only known way to enable advanced financial functions in the field of cryptocurrencies is with the help of secured loans. This simply means that if a user wants to borrow a crypto token (eg stablecoin), he must cover this loan by backing or locking another cryptocurrency (eg Ether). Today, many major DeFi applications work on the principle of secured loans.</p>
<p>The fact that DeFi operates on the principle of secured loans has three implications:</p>
<p>those who provide cryptocurrencies for loan earn interest.</p>
<p>those who borrow cryptocurrencies pay interest.</p>
<p>due to the absence of central authority, the interest rate is always variable.</p>
<h2>Modern financial system vs. decentralized finance</h2>
<p>DeFi services seek to provide higher monetary functions, such as ordinary payments and holding; without the compromises that existing centralized providers of these functions make. If we should help by comparing it to the classical financial system, then native crypto tokens (Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether) are the monetary base, while DeFi services perform the functions of M1-M3 aggregates.
We can imagine a modern financial system as an inverted pyramid, where at the bottom of the pyramid lies the narrowly defined money in the form of the so-called monetary base. The monetary base is money that does not constitute a claim; the base consists of cash and bank reserves (deposits of commercial banks with the central bank).</p>
<p>Cash does not represent a receivable, as when paying in cash, the transaction is settled immediately (the beneficiary has the financial value immediately in hand). Provisions do not constitute a claim, because the central bank does not dispose of these deposits in any way (it does not lend them further, as is the case with deposits in commercial banks). Higher monetary aggregates and financial instruments, on the other hand, always represent a claim - current and term deposits, money market funds, bonds and derivatives are always the holder's claim against the counterparty.</p>
<p>A simple example: money in a bank account is actually a client's claim against the bank. The client does not own the money; the bank actually owes the client the amount that the client sees in its internet banking. The settlement of this receivable occurs, for example, by the client withdrawing cash from the ATM (i.e. a monetary base that does not represent any other receivable).
Why such a comprehensive explanation of what money is? Because cryptocurrencies, together with DeFi, turn this common model upside down. Coins in a user's wallet are best comparable to the monetary base: they are non-receivables. Sending Bitcoin or Monero represents the same level of compensation as payment in cash (provided, of course, that payment is deferred to a sufficient number of confirmations).</p>
<p>As described above, DeFi services operate on the principle of reinsurance. Unlike the modern financial system, there is no principle of real user identity in the area of cryptocurrencies, and thus it is not possible to work with the concept of credit and the enforceability of unsecured contracts. The only thing you can work with are on-chain assets.
In contrast to the expanding pyramid of classical monetary aggregates, the "crypto-monetary" pyramid is thus narrowing, as a result of the principle of secured loans.</p>
<h2>DeFi as a renaissance?</h2>
<p>Decentralized finance is still in its infancy. All of the above applications are highly experimental and dangerous. However, the mere fact that the whole financial service architecture of DeFi can be analysed independently is very positive. We cannot look at today's banks and financial institutions - and as the subprime mortgage crisis of 2007-2008 (excellently portrayed in The Big Short) has shown, it is often not even clear what lies in the very financial contracts that these institutions make up.</p>
<p>Still, one needs to bear in mind that the DeFi sector is extremely complicated. Not only is it relatively new and faces several risks (such as numerous hacks and lack of sufficient security) it also contains several newly discovered concepts and ideas that need to be tested with time. Yield farming, synthetic assets, automated market making protocols, liquidity pools, flash loans or liquidity mining are new concepts that are not only extremely complex, but also need time for improvement and testing. Therefore, eventhough this sector might look very promising, which it without any doubt is, it also needs a lot of clarity and improvement.</p>
<p>Moreover, we will try to provide the best guidance for those, who are willing to try something new and are not afraid of a bit riskier sector with the vision of not only higher returns, but also adopting a new financial sector. While this article was more theoretical and descriptive, following articles on topics of DeFi will be more concerned with specific projects and how they work, operate, what are their strengths and weaknesses and how one can profit from them.</p>

<Excerpt>The sector of decentralized finance (DeFi) has been significantly growing over the past year. With the market value of couple of millions at the beginning of 2020, the sector has grown into multi billion monster that is very quickly taking over several sectors not only in the cryptoworld. However, what exactly is DeFi and why is it getting so much attention?</Excerpt>

<Title>What is Uniswap and how does this leading DEX work?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The world of decentralized finance (DeFi) experienced a huge increase in popularity and usability in 2020. Dozens of new and interesting projects have been added to DeFi, with a large number of them coming to the forefront mainly thanks to community support. One of the most important categories in the world of DeFi is the decentralized exchanges (DEX), which aim to create better trading options for cryptocurrency investors. The best known, largest and also the most used DEX exchange is Uniswap, which we will discuss in this article.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>The founder of Uniswap is Hayden Adams, who published the whitepaper of Uniswap on his Twitter account on November 2, 2018. This exchange is unique mainly due to the fact that it was able to get among the top projects without ICO or any other form of fundraising. Financial support did not come until 2019, when Paradigm Capital invested $ 1 million in the project, and then in August 2020, private investors led by Andreessen Horowitz joined with approximately $ 11 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on May 18, 2020, a new version of Uniswap was released, an upgrade to Uniswap v2, which brought more robust security and solutions to problems with oracle and flash loan hacks, which cause significant losses in the DeFi world. The functionality and simplicity of the user interface of the entire platform has also been improved.</p>
<p>There are two other significant events in the history of the Uniswap exchange. One of them happened at the beginning of September 2020, when after a very successful year in terms of the increase in Total Value Locked (TVL), this Uniswap statistic suddenly began to decline. The reason was simple. The fork of the Uniswap exchange, called Sushiswap, was launched, and used so-called "vampire tactics" to profit from the popularity of the Uniswap exchange.</p>
<p>In short, the DeFi exchange Sushiswap, which was created only at the end of August (August 26, 2020), copied almost everything from the Uniswap exchange and thus represented an automated market maker exchange, but added to this system a governance token, SUSHI, which suddenly represented a financial reward for those, who moved their liquidity from the Uniswap exchange to Sushiswap. Sushiswap simply changed its user interface, adding financial incentives for users to move their liquidity from Uniswap to Sushiswap, and brought the TVL of that exchange from zero to $ 1.42 billion in less than a week.</p>
<p>By contrast, Uniswap lost most of its liquidity in this move, with TVL falling from $ 1.82 billion to about $ 400 million. If the Uniswap exchange did not want to lose all of its liquidity, it had to take a major step. Therefore, Uniswap launched a governance token, UNI, which levelled the scales with projects such as Sushiswap, added a financial incentive for users to return liquidity to Uniswap, which again increased TVL and pool liquidity.</p>
<h2>How does Uniswap work</h2>
<p>Uniswap is a decentralized, automated market making exchange built on Ethereum that provides liquidity through so-called liquidity pools (LPs), in which users can exchange their ERC-20 tokens between two different assets. These can be converted to a given exchange via a Web 3 wallet such as MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Formatic, Portis or Wallet Connect.
At the same time, Uniswap works completely differently from traditional centralized exchanges. The main reason is the removal of order books, which was replaced by the Constant product market maker model. It allows the use of liquidity in the selected pool (which represent a trading pair) and adjusts the price either up or down based on the relative size of the pool. In this way, it is also guaranteed that the pool will never lose its liquidity.
Simply put, when trading on Uniswap, you just choose the cryptocurrency you want to exchange (sell - for example, ETH) for the cryptocurrency you want to get (buy - for example, USDT) and Uniswap will do it for you at market value. Of course, it will also show in advance the expected number of tokens you will receive.
At this point, it must be said that this is really only an estimated number, because there can be a slippage (difference in the amount between entering the trade and executing the trade), price impact and, of course, deducting the fee, all of which can expect the amount you entered. token change. Therefore, before each trade / exchange (swap) on Uniswap, it is necessary to look at the following orders (according to the example).</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Minimum received (2,203 USDT):</strong>
 a guarantee of the smallest number of tokens you will receive if the price of the token you selected moves against you at the time of your trade. If you are not willing to accept the lowest number of tokens you will receive for a given trade, you should not proceed, because even though the possibility of receiving the minimum amount of your chosen token is small, it may occur due to slippage.</p>
<p><strong>Liquidity provider fee (0.000021 ETH):</strong>
 approximately 0.25% to 0.3% of the transaction</p>
<p><strong>Price Impact (<0.01%):</strong>
 in the case of a small pool liquidity, it is possible that your trade will "move the price" of the token you have to receive, which means that its price will move up, so you may get fewer tokens as originally estimated. Price impact depends on the amount you enter, but also on the amount of liquidity of the pool. It is also true that the greater the price impact of your trade, the greater the chance of obtaining a lower number of tokens. For example, a price impact of <0.01% is very small, so a price impact should not occur.</p>
<p><strong>Slippage tolerance (0.5%):</strong>
 protects you from receiving too few tokens of your choice. In the case of a small slippage tolerance, it can cause the transaction to be cancelled.</p>
<p><strong>Transaction deadline (20 minutes):</strong>
 is responsible for ensuring that the transaction is completed within the time limit. If this does not happen, it will be rejected and you will get back the cryptocurrency you entered (Ethereum).</p>
<h2>Providing liquidity through LP</h2>
<p>Exchanging ERC-20 tokens is not the only functionality that Uniswap offers. The second way to use Uniswap is to provide liquidity to one of the pools, for which the liquidity provider can obtain fees from the given pools. When providing liquidity to a pool, it is important that the dollar value of the two tokens provided - for example, ETH and PAX - is the same. Once a person provides liquidity, he receives a so-called "Liquidity tokens," which he can exchange back at any time for his original tokens. "Liquidity tokens" only serve as a confirmation of the provision of liquidity, while also allowing the liquidity provider to see any increase or decrease in the value of the assets, but no loss should be made in dollar value (therefore the same value should be entered in both assets at the beginning).</p>
<p>Liquidity pools also provided an interesting opportunity to make money through various liquidity strategies. For example, if you believe that a certain trading pair has the potential to be more traded in the future, you can provide liquidity in it. If your estimate comes true, a higher number of transactions means a higher number of transaction fees, which means higher fees that are redistributed among liquidity providers.</p>
<p>However, you should also be aware that the higher the liquidity, the smaller the share of the given LP you own and the smaller the share of transaction fees you will receive. The logic behind the model that Uniswap uses is simple. The higher the liquidity -> the smaller the slippage and price of pair of tokens is fairer -> the higher the interest in this currency pair should be -> means larger number of trades and thus an increase in the total trading fees of the pair ->  causes higher earnings for liquidity providers, who will be motivated to provide it in other LPs as well. In this way, Uniswap seeks to encourage the provision of liquidity.</p>
<h2>Advantages of the Uniswap exchange</h2>
<p><strong>First mover advantage:</strong>
 Uniswap is the largest and most well-known name in the DEX world, with daily transaction volumes comparable to leading CEX exchanges. Compared to other DEX exchanges, it is one step ahead, with Curve Finance and Sushiswap keeping the pace with this exchange as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Noncustodial:</strong>
 Unlike centralized exchanges, Uniswap and DeFi themselves are based on the fact that ownership and responsibility for tokens lies solely with their holders. This prevents the trader's funds from being frozen or lost through a hack. In the case of Uniswap, you are still solely responsible for your keys.</p>
<p><strong>No KYC:</strong>
 know-your-customer often encounters resistance in the cryptocurrency world, which is why Uniswap is also for those who do not want to verify themselves on exchanges and try to maintain privacy. There is no need for verification by passport, ID or other identity document. It also eliminates the possibility of stealing or disclosing details about you, which for instance happened in mid-December 2020, when the Ledger hack led to the disclosure of 270,000 home addresses and 1 million email addresses to Ledger's clients. This is not the case with Uniswap.</p>
<p><strong>Easy access to new cryptocurrencies:</strong>
 because Uniswap is decentralized, there is no approval or selection process to decide which cryptocurrency will be listed. New cryptocurrencies are therefore included here relatively quickly, which makes Uniswap interesting due to its offer, especially of smaller lowcap tokens.</p>
<p><strong>Low fees:</strong>
 Uniswap also has lower fees, as is the case with centralized exchanges. Here, of course, it mainly depends on which stock exchanges and in which volumes you trade, but with fees of approximately 0.3% of the trade, Uniswap is one of the cheaper ones.</p>
<p><strong>Very simple UI:</strong>
 unlike its predecessor, such as EtherDelta, Uniswap is one of the simplest and most transparent exchanges in the market in terms of visual interface. No order books, complicated shop settings and the like. Just a simple and clear entry of 2 tokens that you want to exchange or provide liquidity to the LP you desire.</p>
<h2>Disadvantages of the Uniswap exchange</h2>
<p><strong>Lots of scams:</strong>
 easy access to new cryptocurrencies is one of the advantages, but it can also be seen from a negative point of view. Since theoretically any ERC-20 token can get to Uniswap a lot of scams and fake cryptocurrencies can get there. That is why when buying cryptocurrencies, which are only on Uniswap, it is necessary to look for more about the cryptocurrencies and make your investment obligation in a thorough review of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Transaction failure:</strong>
  This is also one of the problems that can occur on Uniswap. These can occur, for example, with a low gas fee, which was not profitable for the miner and thus the transaction was not processed. There may also be a problem with the lack of liquidity in the pool at the time, which would again lead to non-processing of the transaction. However, this is especially a problem with very small tokens with low liquidity and is relatively unlikely to happen with a larger pair.</p>
<p><strong>Regulators:</strong>
 a disadvantage for the future may also be regulators who may try to outlaw the use of Uniswap, as the user or trader does not need to go through KYC. The US authorities have problems with this, but no one can rule out the possibility that greater pressure on the KYC will not be exerted by regulators from Europe or Asia. Even if that happened, Uniswap and the use of any token governance would have to be completely outlawed, as banning a decentralized exchange would be more than difficult.</p>
<p>The Uniswap exchange, with its UNI token, is one of the flagships of decentralized finance. This DEX has certainly helped boost DeFi, helped with its security and functionality, and in the process has built up great community support. Although it has a few disadvantages, if the DeFi world grows, it is very likely that the use and popularity of the Uniswap exchange will also grow.</p>

<Excerpt>Uniswap is the leading decentralized exchange that is being used more every single day. It is one of the most innovative cryptocurrency projects that have risen from DeFi sector and has a lot to offer, which is the reason why we fundamentally analyse this platform.</Excerpt>

<Title>Major currency pairs in Forex trading</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The most traded and most liquid pairs have the US dollar as a minor currency and are called major currency pairs. The US dollar accounts for more than 95% of the foreign exchange market states the most traded and the most liquid currency pairs as following:</p>
<p>•	US Dollar (USD) and British Pounds (GBP) - GBP/USD</p>
<p>•	Euro (EUR) and US Dollar (USD) - EUR/USD</p>
<p>•	Japanese Yen (JPY) and US Dollar (USD) - USD/JPY</p>
<p>•	Swiss Franc (CHF) and US Dollar (USD) - USD/CHF</p>
<p>Taking the main currency like the US dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen or the British pound and comparing it to each other, we get something that is known in the market as 'FX pairs'. It is a growing market where traders prefer to buy or sell a currency for a 'regular rate' rather than sell it for a better rate, resulting in a rise or fall in value the next day or week. Currency pairs are most active when the sessions for their region are active and can be traded online at any hour of each weekday. Traders of FX pairs need to pay attention to every announcement, news or any other valuable information to determine which factors could affect the growth or decline in currency value. For example, monitoring one of the most popular FX currency pairs, such as GBP/USD, then the trader should follow the UK announcements. Data such as a fall in unemployment or an increase in interest rates in the UK are all factors that would normally strengthen the pound. It is also worth paying.</p>
<p><strong>EUR vs USD</strong>
</p>
<p>The US dollar and the Euro are two of the most significant and best-known currencies in the world. The EUR/USD currency pair has globally the largest trading volume and is, therefore, the most traded currency pair. This pair cannot be overlooked because of its daily volatility and price movement.</p>
<p>US Dollar (USD) and Euro (EUR) are the official currencies of the respective US economic zones and countries in the European Union. The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) is the Federal Reserve Department (FED) that determines the direction of monetary policy for the US, which in turn affects the value and perceived value of the US dollar. The European Central Bank (ECB) is the main central bank for the euro and the eurozone and the impact on currency is similar. Both currency pairs are part of the FOREX exchange market. In the Forex market, the price of one currency moves up, down, or side to another currency. Both EUR and USD also generate currency pairs with other currencies such as the Euro against the British Pound (EUR/GBP) or the US Dollar versus the Canadian Dollar (USD/CAD).</p>
<p>When the price of the euro-dollar increases from 1.15 to 1.17, the euro becomes more valuable and the USD becomes less valuable.</p>
<p>•	When the price of the euro-dollar falls from 1.22 to 1.19 the euro becomes less valuable and the USD becomes more valuable.</p>
<p>•	In the opposite case, movements of USD/EUR are alike, when the USD versus the euro increases, the USD becomes more valuable. It is important to note that this version of the abbreviation is not common.</p>
<p>When the price moves up or down, it means that one currency becomes stronger or the other weaker, or even both. If the EUR/USD exchange rate is higher, it could mean that the euro is strengthening against the US dollar, or that it may weaken the US dollar - or both. No matter what price change is, the fact is that traders can monitor the current balance of power by simply tracking price movements on the euro-dollar currency pair. Euro-dollar is either listed by the broker at 4 decimal places, which is 0.0001 pip, or some brokers are able to list EUR/USD at 5 decimal places, 0.00001 pip. An example is the Euro-dollar exchange rate, with EUR/USD fluctuating at an average of 87 pips a day from the beginning of the year on 30 August 2018  -this represents many business opportunities for EUR/USD traders. Where volatility is an important factor because there is no movement on FOREX without volatility. Volatility is often associated with risks, but the trader must not forget that it also can easily turn into opportunity! These opportunities can be risky if the trader applies risk management and when the business strategy is poorly planned. On the other hand, for a trader who follows risk management and has a well-established business plan, trading EUR/USD can become a very rewarding activity.</p>
<p><strong>USD vs JPY</strong>
</p>
<p>The couple dollar-yen is the second most liquid currency pair in the world. The Japanese Yen denotes the third major international currency and represents the globe’s second largest economy in the account of its GDP, after the United States. The interest rate differential between the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) affects the value of USD/JPY when compared to each other. Additionally, correlations between the U.S. and Asian equity markets are a key determinant of the exchange rate. The dollar-yen pair has a positive interrelationship with the USD/CHF along with USD/CAD currency pairs as they both conclude the U.S. dollar as the base currency. USD/JPY has the largest range of traders among the majors and also tends to trade with a higher degree of volatility across all trading sessions. The pair USD/JPY is extremely liquid and it has a tendency to move around a particular price level before there is a sudden rapid movement to a different price level. A trader who wishes to trade USD/JPY pair has to pay attention to the daily or monthly Yen price chart to observe the overall trend of the currency in order to determine in which direction it might move.
Since Japan's exports are all contracted in U.S. dollar, strong yen with an upper hand over U.S. dollar has the potential to cause profit difficulties for Japanese exporters. In the case, the yen would sustain its strength, it would mean a delay for Japan’s efforts to meet its 2 percent inflation target. Japan has the smallest share of its denominated exports in its industrialized countries.</p>
<p><strong>Currency crosses</strong>
</p>
<p>Currency crosses are those pairs that do not include US dollar. They account for only about 12% of the daily turnover. Examples of most traded currency crosses are EUR/GBP, EUR/JPY and EUR/CHF.</p>
<p><strong>Exotic currency pairs</strong>
</p>
<p>Exotic currency pairs are made of US dollar paired with minor currencies, which are often currencies of emerging markets. Combination of wide spreads, lower liquidity and volatile price swings make these pairs unpopular for most traders.</p>
<p>pip, lot</p>
<p>Typically currency pairs on an interbank market are quoted to four decimal places. A pip is the smallest price movement of a currency pair and is expressed as one ten-thousandth of one unit of a currency. Currency pairs that contain Japanese yen as their quote currency make an exception, since they are quoted to two decimal places and thus one pip is equal to one-hundredth of a Japanese yen. Traders use pips to measure the size of a market move and in combination with lot size, traders can calculate potential profits.</p>
<p>When trading currencies, traders have to decide how much they want to buy or sell. Standard lot is equal to 100 000 units of the traded currency. Nowadays most retail brokers also offer the possibility of trading in mini lots, which are equal to 10 000 units of a currency and sometimes even micro lots, which are equal to 1 000 units of a currency. Calculating the value of one pip is helpful to gauge potential P/L of a trade. To calculate value of one pip we have to divide one pip by the exchange rate of the traded currency pair and then multiply it by our chosen lot size. For example when trading a standard lot of EUR/USD with exchange rate of 1,1291 the calculation will be following:</p>
<p>(0,0001/1,1291)*100 000 EUR = 8,8566 EUR</p>
<p>attention to when the government is taking measures such as quantitative easing - when it pours money into the economy to boost growth - because traders can find that a related currency weakens slightly.)</p>

<Excerpt>Exchange rates on the foreign exchange market are constantly being taken from currency pairs. Not all currencies in the world are traded worldwide, there are several countries whose currencies are traded more. These are countries that are both politically and economically stable. Currency pairs are almost the same amount as Forex in the world, but only a few are called major currency pairs.</Excerpt>

<Title>Fundamental vs. Technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>In this article, we shall understand the difference between fundamental and technical analysis.</p>
<p>Fundamental analysis: Goal of fundamental analysis is to discover intrinsic value of a particular instrument and then deciding whether the instrument is undervalued or overvalued by comparing it with current market price. However calculation of intrinsic value differs between individual markets. For example in stock market, there are different valuation methods and indicators of company's financial health. Assessing the “right” valuation of a currency is more tricky, since there are lot of variables determining the exchange rate. Macroeconomic indicators like growth of gross domestic product, interest rates, inflation or unemployment have major impact on currencies. Traders have to be aware of announcements of these key indicators, because they can often result in short-term price movement, especially if the announced indicator is substantially different from the prediction. For illustration, in the year 2007, non-farm payroll (NFP) indicator that is showing new job opportunities in non-farm sector, did produce on average 69 pips move on EUR/USD currency pair in just 20 minutes after the announcement. That is why even purely technical traders should monitor these key macroeconomic reports as they can pose a threat to traders actively trading during these announcements.</p>
<p>Psychological analysis: Human psychology is always present when trading and it can have significant impact on decision making of trader. Emotions like fear and greed are associated with the desire of making profit and can cause irrational behaviour. Contrary to fundamental and technical analysis that study the intrinsic value of the instrument or how the price should change based on historical behaviour, psychological analysis does not study the instrument itself. Instead, it focuses on the trader or investor and studies how he behaves in financial markets. Crowd psychology is used to explain how traders or investors behave in financial markets, where they are surrounded by different market participants.</p>
<p>Technical analysis: This type of analysis is one of the oldest and most popular way of analyzing markets. Technicians do not care about the reason why does certain instrument move or whether it is undervalued or overvalued, as is the case in fundamental analysis. It also is much less demanding in terms of analysis of various statistical, sector or macroeconomic data. That is why it has become very popular, especially for individual traders and investors.</p>
<p>Primary objective of technical analysis is timing of entries near the start of a trend and then holding onto the trend till it reverses. Technicians believe that by studying historical price action, they can predict future price movement. That is why technicians do not look for the reason of a price movement, but rather when and in which direction will the price movement occur. Primary tool of technical traders is a price chart, that contains information about historical price movement and volume traded. There are different types of price charts, which will be discussed later. Using price charts, traders look for certain patterns that had occurred in the past and expect similar outcome from these patterns in the future. By analyzing and backtesting historical price behaviour, traders create trading strategies that they execute in real time. Needless to say, even the best strategies do not work all the time and traders must think in term of probabilities.</p>
<p>The basis of technical analysis can be summed up to three main principles:</p>
<li>Market discounts everything</li>
<p>All published information relevant to certain instrument is absorbed in price of the instrument. Market participants do not have the same access to published information and do not react to the information at the same pace. Because of this, information is absorbed into price of the instrument gradually. This causes development of trend, which technical traders attempt to capitalize on.</p>
<li>Patterns exist in marketplace</li>
<p>Price tends to move in trends and patterns that can offer good trading opportunities, if recognized by trader in real time. That is why technicians study historical patterns that result in certain price movement.</p>
<li>History repeats itself</li>
<p>Prices of financial instruments are determined by supply and demand, which is affected by behaviour of market participants. These participants are likely to react to certain situations in market similarly, regardless of their investment horizon. Because of this, market patterns are likely to repeat, since they are formed by changes in supply and demand, which is affected by human behaviour that is relatively stable regardless of time.</p>

<Excerpt>The investors and traders have made good wealth in the stock market in the past few years. Therefore, more and more people are taking interest and participating in the share market. In fact, the traders and investors follow different methodologies while investing or trading. There are two methodologies in the stock market; fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Both the methodologies are very different from each other.</Excerpt>

<Title>How do trading styles differ? </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Position trading</strong>
</p>
<p>Position traders aim to capture long-term trends that last from few months up to few years. They often use fundamental analysis for the main idea generation, sometimes combined with technical analysis to time entry of the trade. Traders use weekly or monthly price charts and try to ignore short-term price fluctuations in order to capture long-term trends. Main advantages of this approach are the time flexibility it offers and the potential of profiting from large moves in the market. Traders have to be very patient with their positions, but at the same time ready to act when the opportunity comes, because not participating in large trends can have significant impact on their yearly profits.</p>
<p><strong>Swing trading</strong>
</p>
<p>Swing trading is a style where traders look to capture short to medium-term market moves, also known as swings. They mostly use technical analysis on four hour price charts to identify entry points offering good risk to reward opportunities. Since open positions are held from few days up to few weeks, this style offers time flexibility and traders do not have to monitor their positions all the time. This is why swing trading is a popular style among retail and beginner traders.</p>
<p><strong>Day trading</strong>
</p>
<p>Day trading is a short-term trading style where positions are never held overnight. Traders focus on capturing intra-day price fluctuations using technical analysis on a lower chart timeframes. This style requires trader to observe the market during the trading session and make quick decisions based on his strategy. Because of shorter holding periods, day traders are able to capture much smaller price moves than swing or position traders. That is compensated by much bigger trade frequency, usually averaging several trades a day.</p>
<strong>Scalping</strong>
<li> is an extreme version of day trading, where traders hold positions for very short period of time ranging from few seconds up to few minutes. They are actively buying or selling throughout the trading sessions, opening dozens or even hundreds of trades. Due to this high trade frequency, traders are looking for a few pips of profit at a time.</li>
<p>Day trading and scalping share similar advantages and disadvantages for individual traders. Advantages of these styles are the ability of generating outsized returns due to the high trade frequency and possibility of increasing their buying power through the use of leverage. On the other hand there are many disadvantages, such as the need of constantly analyzing and making quick decisions based on market behaviour. These decisions can be the difference between making or loosing money, which can be very tiring and stressful. Another disadvantage are the costs associated with higher trading frequency, that can significantly reduce their profits. Active traders need to find suitable broker for their trading needs in order to reduce the spreads and commissions to the minimum. For these reasons day trading and scalping are generally considered as more difficult trading styles and are not recommended for beginner traders.</p>
<p><strong>High-frequency trading (HFT)</strong>
</p>
<p>The growth in electronic execution methods in forex market has enabled algorithmic trading, which is a style of trading where computer algorithms analyses certain markets and execute orders based on specific market behaviour. High-frequency trading (HFT) is an algorithmic strategy that profits from tiny price movements with rapid trade frequency executing trades that last only a fractions of a second. HFT plays a significant role in FX with market estimates suggesting it accounts for around 25% of spot forex turnover Since the success of HFT relies heavily on execution speed, firms fight for location as close as possible to the servers of an exchange. This fact combined with the need of having very powerful computers able to run complex algorithms makes competing with high-frequency trading firms nearly impossible for independent traders.</p>

<Title>Where to draw support and resistance levels on a chart?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Support level</strong>
 represents a level at which traders stop initiating their short positions, because they believe that price of the instrument has become cheap enough. When the price of instrument is close to the support level, market is considered to be oversold. Traders then expect that other market participants will find this cheap price attractive and begin to buy the instrument resulting in increased demand and rising price.</p>
<p><strong>Resistance level</strong>
 is on the other hand a level at which traders believe that price of the instrument is too expensive for opening a long position. When the price is close to the resistance level, market is considered to be overbought. It is expected that other market participants will use the overbought condition to either close their current long positions or initiate new short positions resulting in increased supply and declining price.</p>
<p>It is important to look at support and resistance as levels and not a simple horizontal lines on a price chart. In other words, support and resistance levels should not represent a single price, but rather a zone of certain width that is based on used time frame. As already stated, these levels are created based on a believe, that certain instrument is overbought or oversold. Issue is that every market participant has different idea at which exact price instrument begins to be oversold or overbought. This is why we should treat support and resistance levels as zones. Following chart shows price moving between clearly established support and resistance levels their demand of the instrument, which results in the price stopping its rising tendency or even reversing back or under the previous level of resistance. Between traders, this behaviour is called a “pullback” and refers to price breaking a significant level of support and resistance and then returning back to the level.</p>
<p>After price breaks an important level, there are generally three scenarios that can happen:</p>
<p><strong>First scenario</strong>
 is called a breakout and refers to price surpassing support/resistance level and then continuing to move lower/higher. In this case traders believe that price breaking through a level was justified and believe that it will continue to move in the same direction in the future. Breakouts often happen in the direction of a trend leading into support/resistance level. In following example, we can see clearly established resistance level, that resulted in a breakout, sending price higher in the direction of the overall trend.</p>
<p><strong>Second scenario</strong>
 refers to a situation where previous resistance level becomes new support level, or previous support level becomes new resistance level. This situation happens when price breaks an important level (in this case resistance), but instead of continuing higher it pulls back to the previous resistance, which now acts as a support. Traders who believe, that price should continue higher will welcome this opportunity to buy for a cheaper price and will buy near or at the new support level. This scenario is illustrated in the following chart.</p>
<p>The <strong>last scenario</strong>
 occurs when price breaks resistance level, but does not continue higher and instead returns back below the level, that now again acts as a resistance. For support level the exact opposite happens, price breaks support level, but cannot sustain a continued decline resulting in price returning above the support level. This situation is known as bull/bear trap, or also known as false breakout, which will be the used term throughout this paper. In relation to prevailing trend in the market, false breakouts are divided into with-trend and counter-trend false breakouts. Counter-trend false breakout occurs when price breaks a level in the direction of prevailing trend, but then returns back below/above the level and continues in the opposite direction to the trend. With-trend false breakout would be the opposite and is illustrated in the following chart for better clarification. Large institutional players will expect, that most stop-loss orders will be right below the support level. If the price breaks the support, these orders will be triggered and traders who bought before the breakdown will be forced to sell their positions. Additionally, breakout traders will now change their bias from bullish to bearish and will open short positions, anticipating price to move lower. This offers needed liquidity for large institutional players, who are looking to buy large positions in the market. This increased demand caused by institutional players will drive price higher above the support level, triggering stop-losses of traders who sold on the breakout. This will further fuel the price higher. This situation is also known as stop hunting. Stop hunting is a strategy that attempts to force some market participants out of their positions by driving the price of an asset to a level where many individuals have chosen to set their stop-loss orders. The triggering of many stop losses generally leads to high volatility and can present a unique opportunity for investors who seek to trade in this environment.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Technical analysis of Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Current situation</h2>
<p>Before we move on to a specific Bitcoin chart, we should describe the current market situation. In recent days, we have seen a great correlation in the whole market. Bitcoin is in decline, but it is not Bitcoin alone. Quite the opposite. Stocks, commodities, and indices are also falling. What could be the reason behind this?</p>
<p>Of course, we can’t be entirely sure, but as I have been saying for quite some week already, something is happening on the market. Something is wrong and Bitcoin pays for it. Overall, Bitcoin is has been experiencing a very weak March so far, and in recent years it has been the rule that during March we could witness the most significant correction.</p>

<span class="img-caption">4H Bitcoin chart (source: TradingView)</span>
<h2>Weekly chart</h2>
<p>If we take look at the weekly chart, we can notice that something is wrong. The black candle that closed last week was too strong because it completely erased the body of the previous candle.</p>
<p>I have already seen several similar candles and the vast majority of them meant the current TOP. Personally, I think that the bull market will continue, but a correction of larger proportions is really inevitable.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/Bitcoin_technical_Weekly_3609c2a1ad.PNG" alt="default">
<span class="img-caption">Weekly Bitcoin chart (source: TradingView)</span>
<h2>Monthly chart</h2>
<p>Furthermore, if we also look at the monthly chart, the top shadow of the candle does not show anything good. If we focus on the bodies of the candles, then we can notice that it has been growing for the last 6 months. From this point of view as well, there would really be a need for some halt (or at least slowdown) in this growth.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Monthly Bitcoin chart (source: TradingView)</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I don't think the bull market would end, or the cryptocurrencies in general. Rather, I think that it is finally time for a more extensive correction, which also indicates the price. All the processes that are happening in the background are in order which is good. However, a Bitcoin price chart could really benefit from a monthly correction and it would be a welcome change in pace in the long run as well.</p>

<Title>What is Bitcoin and how cryptocurrencies work?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrencies are not physical currencies such as the euro but exist only in the digital realm. That is why we also call them digital currencies. Does it seem complicated to you? No worries! We will make sure to go through the basic concepts one step after the other.</p>
<li>Title: Bitcoin</li>
<li>Designation: BTC</li>
<li>Origin: r. 2008</li>
<li>Founder: Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym)</li>
<li>Total BTC: 21,000,000</li>
<li>The last bitcoin will be mined in about 2145</li>
<li>Units: 1 BTC = 1000 mBTC = 1,000,000 bits (uBTC) = 1,000,000,000 satoshi</li>
<h2>What actually is Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin cryptocurrency was created in 2008 by a mysterious person or group of persons known by the pseudonym <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong>
. His / their identity is still unknown and will probably remain so forever.</p>
<p>The initial idea that led to the formation of the cryptocurrency of Bitcoin was published by Nakamoto in a scientific article called <strong>Bitcoin: Peer-to-peer Electronic Cash System</strong>
.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is actually a currency that belongs to everyone and serves as an intermediary for exchange. Digital currencies use cryptography to secure financial transactions. It is a form of control over the production of additional units (new bitcoin coins) and verification of the transfer of funds - hence the term - <strong>cryptocurrency</strong>
. Because it does not belong to anyone yet at the same time it belongs to everyone, everyone can participate in its use and development.</p>
<p>There are several benefits to using Bitcoin. One of them is that there is no central body for cryptocurrencies, such as a bank in the classical financial world. Unlike bank transfers, transactions take only a few minutes. If you need to transfer money to the other side of the world, it can get really complicated. Especially if these funds are in another currency. It takes several days and the bank usually charges pricey fees.</p>
<h2>The main features of Bitcoin</h2>
<strong>Bitcoin is a non-centralized virtual currency</strong>
<li> because it functions in the system without a central bank or a single administrator. The value of this virtual currency is not controlled by any central authority, but by the users themselves. In a way, it is a currency that really belongs to the people.</li>
<strong>Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency</strong>
<li> because it is a virtual currency and has no physical form (coins or banknotes). It serves as a medium of exchange and uses cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the production of additional units (new bitcoin coins) and verify the transfer of funds.</li>
<strong>Bitcoin is an open-source system</strong>
<li>, which means that no one owns it and anyone can participate in its use and development.</li>
<strong>21,000,000 coins</strong>
<li> - this is the final number of bitcoin coins</li>
<p>There are several benefits when it comes to using Bitcoin. One of them is the <strong>absence of a central body</strong>
, such as a bank. Suppose we have to transfer € 1000 from Slovakia to your relatives in Spain. The money passes through a bank in Slovakia and fees are being charged for processing the transfer of funds. Your relatives' Spanish bank may also charge fees, and, on top of that, the whole process may take several days, especially if you are sending money to a country with its own national currency.</p>
<p>There are no centralized authorities when paying by Bitcoin, and in most cases, transactions take only a few minutes, even if you send money to the other side of the world. In addition, Bitcoin is a currency that is not limited by state borders. Slowness and geographical constraints are not the only disadvantages of traditional banking institutions. Banks can freeze or block their clients' accounts at any time, sometimes even without sufficient justification. That is why some people think that banks have too much power in their hands.</p>
<p>You may have also noticed that Bitcoin emerged shortly after the financial crisis in 2008. Some even believe that it was the crisis that helped to give rise to the idea of a decentralized currency and that it was one of the reasons why Bitcoin arose as a possible future for the monetary system.</p>
<h2>Decentralized networks</h2>
<p>If you go to a web browser and enter "www.google.com", your computer will start a conversation with Google computers. This way, they will start interacting with each other, and your browser will display images, buttons, etc. If Google's servers are down for any reason, you will not see these images and buttons. The reason is that the data is stored in a centralized network - in one place.</p>
<p>To understand how Bitcoin works, it is essential to understand what a decentralized network is. In a decentralized network, data is everywhere. If Google would have used a decentralized network, you should still have been able to see the data, because it is everywhere, not just in one place. This means that Google would never go offline ever again.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks to its properties, Bitcoin offers:</strong>
</p>
<li>collective verification of transactions by nodes and miners in the public ledger</li>
<li>a system based on voluntariness and openness</li>
<li>transparent monetary policy that is unchanging and well-known</li>
<li>payment system available 24/7/365</li>
<li>a world community that knows no state borders</li>
<li>a system that does not discriminate or require its user to disclose their personal data</li>
<li>stability and robustness of the most secure blockchain protocol in the world</li>
<li>freedom, control, and responsibility in the hands of the user (be your own bank)</li>
<li>resistance to censorship and adverse regulations</li>
<li>speed and low charges</li>
<li>possibility of the indelible time stamp in network data</li>
<li>capacities to preserve value and maintain liquidity</li>
<li>a deflationary alternative to inflationary currencies</li>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, we have briefly explained the basic concepts. However, the whole issue of Bitcoin and Blockchain is much more extensive. <strong>What exactly is Blockchain and how does it work? Where can I buy bitcoin? Why is Bitcoin so valuable? Is Bitcoin just a bubble?</strong>
 There are a lot of questions, and all of them will be covered in our articles</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>There is no doubt that you have already heard the term Bitcoin. But do you know how this most famous cryptocurrency actually works? In this article, we will find answers to the most rudimental questions that arise when we utter such words as Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.</Excerpt>

<Title>What is blockchain and how does it work?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>What exactly is a blockchain? There are many lessons and characteristics on the Internet, so let us go through them briefly.</p>
<p>You can think of Blockchain as an online book of accounting records and a specific type of database. However, unlike conventional databases, this database is not centralized, but quite the opposite - decentralized. This means that it has no central administrator and is located on a large number of computers all around the world. A blockchain is often referred to as a distributed database (imagine, for example, a huge Excel spreadsheet), in which all the records are stored forever. An even better analogy, however, is the <strong>endless book of accounting records</strong>
.</p>
<p>However, neither example explains by far what makes the blockchain so unique. In fact, Blockchain is not so much a completely new revolutionary technology as it is often said - all the elements it uses, i.e. the Internet, cryptography, and the transmission protocol, have been with us for decades (cryptography even longer). So <strong>Blockchain is not revolutionary because of its state-of-the-art innovative technologies, but rather because of the way it combines hitherto incompatible technologies</strong>
. We can use the same example in the case of the Internet and mobile phones. They had worked separately for many years before, but then a turning point came and the Internet began to be part of mobile phones, as it is today.</p>
<h2>So what makes it different?</h2>
<p>Currently, the so-called centralized database model is what we are used to. This means that you have one large data center with a huge number of hard drives and a fast connection, through which a large amount of information constantly flows. The problem with this approach is obvious. Destroy the data center and you will lose all the data. An example is a bank transaction. Even banks use a lot of data and have to mark their entire money flow. If I want to send money from my account, it must be verified and approved by the bank. Our  <strong>finances</strong>
 are therefore <strong>centralized</strong>
 because without a bank (data center) we will not carry out any transaction.</p>
<p>Simply put, a <strong>blockchain is a very specific form of a database</strong>
. It is distributed, does not have a central administrator, can be read by anyone, but can only be edited after all its participants have agreed to. This agreement (consensus) is created through the voting of financially motivated network participants (at least in the case of a public blockchain because there are other concepts). Thanks to this, it is possible to securely and permanently store data or transactions without the need for central supervisory authority, therefore there is not a single easily vulnerable link in the whole chain.</p>
<h2>Blockchain and cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>So, blockchain is not a cryptocurrency, but a technology on which cryptocurrencies work. For example, if I want to send 1 bitcoin, blockchain will play the role of a bank. The first person to use blockchain together with cryptocurrencies was <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong>
. Up to this day, the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains a mystery. He created Bitcoin - the first cryptocurrency in the world to use blockchain technology. Figuratively speaking, the blockchain is a kind of a godfather of Bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies. At the moment, Bitcoin is the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world and has the largest market capitalization. If you do not know what Bitcoin is, I recommend you read the article: <a href="https://investro.com/crypto/do-you-know-what-bitcoin-is-and-how-cryptocurrencies-work-nowadays">Do you know what Bitcoin is and how cryptocurrencies work today</a>
<strong>?</strong>
</p>
<p>Can you imagine Bitcoin running on a centralized database? Surely, it could work, there is no doubt, but probably no one would want it, so it would have no value. If any clerk could freeze your bitcoins or remove them from your account at the instigation of the state or the police, it would render it useless. In the case of Bitcoin, blockchain, therefore, replaces the central authority - the bank. Until 2008, there was no way to carry out financial transactions without a central point. Blockchain together with cryptocurrencies brought an alternative.</p>
<h2>Why is blockchain revolutionary?</h2>
<strong>It is safe</strong>
<li> - There are no human errors because no one controls or influences the blockchain. No one can edit anything retrospectively.</li>
<strong>It is decentralized</strong>
<li> - Blockchain has no center and works thanks to the users themselves; so-called peer-to-peer.</li>
<strong>It is transparent</strong>
<li> - Everything on the blockchain is transparent and easy to trace</li>
<strong>It is secure</strong>
<li> - All data is secure thanks to encryption by a hashing algorithm.</li>
<li>Falsifying blockchain entries is very difficult, if not impossible.</li>

<Excerpt>Today, virtually everyone knows cryptocurrencies, but only some know what Blockchain is. Is it a cryptocurrency? What is the connection between Blockchain and cryptocurrencies? And why are there those who perceive blockchain as something revolutionary and groundbreaking?</Excerpt>

<Title>How are cryptocurrencies divided?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The initial division begins with Bitcoin as the first and largest cryptocurrency and is, therefore, separated from all other cryptocurrencies. These are collectively referred to as altcoins, ie alternative cryptocurrencies to Bitcoin. Although some cryptocurrencies work on a similar principle and source code as Bitcoin, most altcoins slightly differ. Whether it is because of the algorithms they are made of or protocols on which they work. They can also differ in their nature or platform. This divides them into two categories, which we will introduce in more detail in this article. These are coins and tokens.</p>
<p>But first, we must note that cryptocurrencies are divided on the basis of various parameters. In this article, we will show the difference between coins and tokens. However, cryptocurrencies can be divided based on several characteristics. Such as:</p>
<strong>Based on the method of mining</strong>
<li> - Proof of work, proof of stake</li>
<strong>Based on their recoverability</strong>
<li> - Bitcoin is mined gradually, but there are also coins that have already been pre-mined</li>
<strong>Based on their anonymity</strong>
<li> - Likewise, cryptocurrencies can be divided according to the level of anonymity they provide their users</li>
<strong>Based on their purpose</strong>
<li> - Cryptocurrencies could be divided based on the purpose for which they were created. There are cryptocurrencies that are supposed to serve as a means of exchange, but on the other hand, we have those that are focused, for example, on the optimization of processes in companies, </li>
<strong>gaming</strong>
<li>, </li>
<strong>streaming</strong>
<li>, and the like.</li>
<p>If you thought that there is only Bitcoin, I recommend you to take a look at the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/">Coinmarketcap </a>
page. On this page are almost all cryptocurrencies that are listed on stock exchanges. The crypto world is no longer just about Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency coins</h2>
<p>Coins are a type of cryptocurrencies that function on their own blockchain, such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, but also some cryptocurrencies that are formed by hard forks, by literally splitting itself, such as Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum Classic. Coins usually function as <strong>transactional cryptocurrencies</strong>
, which are designed as <strong>currency for the purchase</strong>
 and sale of goods and services. Their purpose is to streamline and decentralize current money so that it is more transparent and does not need intermediaries.</p>
<p>Some coins can even be anonymous, as in the case of Monero. Although coins are generally mined, there are exceptions. So recoverability is not a clear indicator of whether it is a coin or not. In other words, the <strong>cryptocurrency that is mined is always a coin, but not the other way around</strong>
, because there are coins that are not mined. For example, XRP, whose network is not based around mining, but on the synchronization and comparison of data of individual nodes.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency tokens</h2>
<p>Tokens are cryptocurrencies that <strong>do not have their own blockchain</strong>
 but function on the blockchain of another cryptocurrency. Most often on the Ethereum blockchain, on which most ICO projects are created, or also Neo, Eos, and others.<strong>ICO stands for Initial Coin Offering</strong>
 and it is the process by which most tokens are created, essentially it is the initial donation. Tokens represent the currency of the project to which they belong, but they are also assets that can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or assets.</p>
<p>Platforms, therefore, create space for new cryptocurrency projects, such as decentralized applications, in which tokens act as currency, and this way they fuel said applications. Creating a token is logically easier than creating a coin because <strong>there is no need to create a new blockchain</strong>
. This is mainly made possible by the implementation of smart contracts, which operate autonomously and do not need any third party or intermediary. It is also worth mentioning that tokens may have a different role in a given project. We can divide them into utilities, payments, or asset tokens. Each <strong>token type</strong>
 is something <strong>specific</strong>
 within the project ecosystem.</p>
<p>In general, not only within the realm of cryptocurrencies, the term token refers to a string of letters and numbers that may not contain real data, but is based on or refers to them.</p>
<p><strong>For example, a token might look like this:</strong>

947153d332beaf39dec6ebae8883bfb84eda47abccccbc2d61436d8d1e81584d</p>
<p>In the banking world, we all know from first-hand experience, we perceive the token as a <strong>unique cluster of characters</strong>
 with no meaning and single-use purpose. In this case, it is connected to the client’s card via a payment intermediary. At the moment when the customer pays with his card, the merchant only receives the token through which the payment is made, but does not see the data associated with the customer's card. After all, this data does not even play a role in the creation process of the token. If someone hacks the system, the customer’s data is safe because it is owned by a bank or card company.</p>

<Excerpt>There are already several thousand cryptocurrencies today, but not all of them have the same purpose and character, although all are labeled the same - as cryptocurrency. This article will look at different cryptocurrency types and explain how they work.</Excerpt>

<Title>Chart typology </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Line Chart</strong>
</p>
<p>Line chart is the most basic chart used in technical analysis. It is often used by analysts to quickly gauge the market price, as it is very simple to see how the price changed over time. It is constructed by connecting the closing prices for each period over a chosen time frame. Users can also choose to calculate the line based on opening, highest or lowest prices, but closing prices are used most often.</p>
<p><strong>Bar Chart</strong>
</p>
<p>Bar chart does offer more information than line chart and because of that, it is more popular between traders. Bar chart gives us information about opening and closing price, as well as lowest and highest price reached for the chosen time frame. Each bar represents period of time based on our chosen time frame. For example one hour time frame means, that each bar represents information about price movement over a period of one hour. Each bar has two horizontal dashes that show opening and closing prices. Left dash represents opening price and right one closing price.</p>
<p><strong>Candlestick Chart</strong>
</p>
<p>Candlestick chart was developed back in 18th century in Japan by rice trader Munehisa Homma. Since then it has become very popular since it is simple, yet powerful tool for analyzing markets. Construction of candlestick chart is similar to bar chart, but the individual bars are in form of “candlesticks”. Candlesticks are made of body and wick. Body of a candlestick represents price range between opening and closing prices. Wicks of a candlestick show the highest and lowest price reached over a chosen time frame. Based on colour of the candlestick we can see whether the price ended up higher or lower at the close of a candlestick. Most commonly used colour combinations are red and green or black and white, where green/white colours show that closing price is above the opening price, thus indicating rise of price over a period of chosen time frame. Black/red colours show that closing price is below the opening price, indicating decline of price.</p>
<p>Although candlestick chart might look complex in the beginning, it can be very useful tool if understood correctly. Traders realized this long time ago and created many different candlestick patterns that can be used to predict future price movement. These patterns consist of one or few specifically looking candlesticks. They can provide powerful signals, but it is recommended to use candlestick patterns in combination with other tools of technical analysis. They usually represent a reversal signals that can cause turn in trend and with combination with other tools can offer great trading opportunities.</p>
<p>It would be good to follow this also to say a little about trends and timeframes:</p>
<p><strong>Trend</strong>
</p>
<p>Successful technicians always look for trends in the marketplace. Trends represent imbalance in orderflow and thus trading in the direction of prevailing trend offers higher probability opportunities in comparison to counter-trend trading. “Trend is your friend” is well known saying among technical analysis traders. Trends can last for a long time and we can never know when the trend is going to change. Trying to predict turning point of well established trend is much more difficult and often less profitable than trading in the direction of the trend.</p>
<p>There are two types of trends: bullish and bearish trend. Bullish trend, also called uptrend, indicates continually rising prices of certain instrument. On the other hand bearish trend, also called downtrend indicates continually declining prices. Existence of trend does not mean, that price is going to rise/decline in a straight line. Even if there is well established trend, price ebbs and flows, creating a series of highs and lows. Uptrend would then be defined by continually making higher highs and higher lows.</p>
<p><strong>Timeframes and trends</strong>
</p>
<p>Based on preferred trading style, traders choose time frame from which they analyze market. In modern trading platforms, charts can be displayed on many different time frames. Chosen time frame shows price movement during that time period represented by single bar or candlestick. Taking time frames into consideration when identifying trends is important, because type of trend can differ across different time frames. For example an insignificant pullback on daily time frame can look like a major trend on lower time frame. Following charts show the difference in prevailing trend between daily and one hour time frame. If we look at the grey box illustrated on the daily time frame chart from the perspective of hourly time frame, we can see that what looks like a simple pullback in a major uptrend on daily time frame, is actually a bearish trend on the lower time frame. Using different time frames when analyzing markets helps traders to gauge the overall context and make more informed decisions.</p>

<Excerpt>Price charts are the most important tool for technicians. There are three main types of charts and each has its advantages and disadvantages. Charts are used to analyze the historical price movement and can be combined with other tools such as various technical indicators and oscillators. Nowadays most charting platforms offer this feature alongside different graphical formations that can be drawn on price charts. These are for example trend lines, horizontal and vertical lines and many other formations that can help in analyzing the market.</Excerpt>

<Title>What is Ethereum?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What is Ethereum?</h2>
<p>Ethereum, like bitcoin, is a cryptocurrency based on a decentralized database that stores and protects an ever-increasing number of records. In computer science, this special database type is referred to by the English word blockchain. At the same time, however, it is a <strong>decentralized virtual machine</strong>
 for running so-called "smart contracts".</p>
<span class="post-quote">“For Bitcoin, Blockchain is the same as the Internet for email - a large electronic system on which you can build applications. Cryptocurrency is just one of those apps”</span>
<span class="quote-author"> Sally Davies</span>
<p>The Russian-Canadian programmer and cryptocurrency developer, Vitalik Buterin, is the one responsible for creating Ethereum. He also took part in the early adoption of Bitcoin. However, rather than creating a new cryptocurrency, developers wanted to create a shared computing platform that allows them to use blockchain to run decentralized applications.</p>
<p>The entire development was financed by crowdfunding with almost 18 million euros collected. The Ethereum network was subsequently launched on July 30, 2015, approximately two years after the whole concept behind Ethereum had been introduced. By its nature, Ethereum belongs to the category of cryptocurrencies of the second generation. These are often referred to as Bitcoin 2.0.</p>
<h2>Ethereum - ideal environment for smart contracts</h2>
<p>The primary purpose behind Ethereum’s inception is to improve intelligent contracts and extend them to a wide range of practices, where they could replace and in a way decentralize, for example, all classic contracts and agreements. Their functioning is absolutely essential for the operation of the entire network, and this is why Ethereum differs significantly from bitcoin.</p>
<p>By definition, a <em>smart contract</em>
 is any protocol or software that <strong>secures, verifies, or enforces the agreement or conclusion of a contract</strong>
. While a standard contract describes the terms of a relationship (usually enforceable by law), smart contracts enforce these terms using a cryptographic code.</p>
<p>Bitcoin was the first technology to support basic smart contracts in the sense that the network can transfer something valuable from one person to another. The entire network of nodes confirms and approves the transaction only if all specified conditions are met. However, Bitcoin is exclusively limited to currency only. In contrast, Ethereum has replaced the very limited Bitcoin scripting language (which contains only about 100 scripts) with a language that allows developers to write their own programs, and consequently also intelligent contracts.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/contract_eeeb23955c.jpg" alt="Different functions of Ethereum blockchain">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Smart Contracts scheme</span>
<p>Smart contracts are actually programs that act according to their inventors’ bidding. This could be helping you to exchange money, property, stocks, or simply anything valuable in a transparent and non-conflicting process. All this in a way that avoids contact with third parties (lawyer, notary). A very popular example of how to explain smart contracts is comparing them to a digital vending machine. Computer scientist and cryptologist, Nick Szabo, described how users can enter data or something valuable into a vending machine and then get a final item from the same machine (for example a drink or a house).</p>
<h2>Ether serves as a fuel for the Ethereum network</h2>
<p>Each action sequence in the Ethereum network costs a certain amount of "fuel", which is based on the required computing power and overall duration of the sequence. Instead of functioning as a classic virtual currency, ether is used as the digital fuel of the entire network.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/ether_a516f514af.jpg" alt="Ethereum Fuel station ">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Ether could be perceived as a "fuel" in the Ethereum blockchain</span>
<p>At the instigation of smart contract administrators, miners request a certain action to take place (change, deletion, modification of the program). For this, they are rewarded in ethers. For example, a normal transaction costs 500 units of fuel. This amount is then converted to ethers and the resulting amount acts as a transaction fee, similar to bitcoins.</p>
<h2>Difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum</h2>
<p>As already mentioned, Bitcoin and Ethereum are networks based on a public and decentralized blockchain database. Although there are significant technical differences between these networks, the most significant one is the fact that <strong>Bitcoin and Ethereum are completely different regarding their purpose and capabilities</strong>
. While Bitcoin’s blockchain is used to track transactions with Bitcoin virtual currency, Ethereum’s blockchain focuses on running the source code of any decentralized application (smart contracts).</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/ethvsbit_b559778e53.jpg" alt="Bitcoin versus Ethereum ">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 3: There are many key differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum</span>
<p>Another difference is the average time to extract one block. It takes about 10 minutes to complete it in the Bitcoin database, while in the case of Ether it is only 12 seconds. As a result, <strong>transaction confirmation is faster</strong>
. Ether does not have to solve the same scaling problems that have long accompanied Bitcoin. More than two-thirds of all bitcoins have already been mined, and most of them are now owned by the first bitcoin miners. On the contrary, Ethereum has decided to offer the first Ethers in advance, and presumably by 2020 half of all Ethers will be mined.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Hard Fork - not only Bitcoin was divided into two branches</h2>
<p>Practically from the day of its creation, Ethereum attracted a lot of attention. The turning point came in 2016 when the DAO (Distributed Autonomous Organization) was established. The goal of DAO was to provide a decentralized business model to commercial as well as non-profit companies through intelligent contracts on the Ethereum network. In less than a month, $ 150 million was raised for this ambitious project. The problem came a month later when hackers took this organization by storm, resulting in $ 50 million worth of Ether in losses.</p>

<Title>What is Cardano?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Cardano - introduction</h2>
<p>Cardano is a smart contract blockchain like Ethereum. It seeks to bring to the world a decentralized environment in which decentralized applications, smart contracts, and decentralized financing projects can operate efficiently and easily. All this without any need for an intermediary. In other words, Cardano is or aspires to be, a direct competitor of Ethereum. However, there are a few differences between these two cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>Cardano up close and personal</h2>
<p>One of the first differences between Cardano and Ethereum, which will immediately stick to your mind, is the Cardano inflation ceiling. This means that one day the last ADA coins will be created and from there on, no more additional coins. This makes Cardano slightly similar to Bitcoin which is also limited.</p>
<p>Cardano coins are called <strong>ADA</strong>
 and they are named after the famous British mathematician <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong>
. There will be a maximum of 45 billion. At present, around 70% is already in circulation, which means that Cardano's final offer will increase even more.</p>
<p>The main face of the Cardano cryptocurrency is <strong>Charles Hoskinson</strong>
, who was also involved in the creation of the Ethereum cryptocurrency, but he does not like to be called its co-founder (which is probably due to the fact that he and Ethereum main founder, Vitalik Buterin, does not have a very good relationship).</p>
<p>There are currently 3 companies involved in the development of Cardano - <strong>IOHK</strong>
, where Charles Hoskinson is the CEO, the non-profit organization <strong>Cardano Foundation</strong>
, and <strong>Emurgo</strong>
. Whether this organizational structure will remain the same in the future is unknown. After the completion of the Voltaire phase, the future of these companies will be decided in a decentralized community vote.</p>
<h2>Cardano works on the Proof of Stake Consensus</h2>
<p>As long as Ethereum still operates on the Proof of Work consensus, which requires power consumption to verify transactions and maintain the security of the entire network, Cardano is a type of blockchain that has already successfully transitioned to the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus during the Shelley phase. It is more ecological, but first of all, it brings great potential for a successful solution to the "blockchain trilemma" problem, i.e. to make the blockchain fast, but at the same time safe and decentralized.</p>
<p>In this respect, for example, both Bitcoin and Ethereum (if they do not completely switch to Proof of Stake within a few years) are failing. Although they are secure and decentralized, they have slow and often costly transactions.</p>
<h2>Smart contracts</h2>
<p>It is important to know that if Cardano also successfully completes the <strong>Goguen</strong>
 phase, this blockchain will have the long-awaited ability to run decentralized applications, making Cardano a direct competitor to Ethereum.</p>
<p>At that moment (the start of the Goguen phase is expected in the first half of 2021), Cardano will probably be technologically superior to Ethereum. It will have much faster and cheaper transactions and the same, or better, functionality compared to the current state of Ethereum.</p>
<p>In addition, Cardano will allow easy conversion of ERC20 tokens from the Ethereum blockchain to the Cardano blockchain. It will also have an environment through which Ethereum developers can very easily implement their applications on Cardano. Simply put, Ethereum developers will not have to learn a new programming language.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it should be noted that at the time of writing of this article, these are still only promises and not existing solutions. Moreover, even if these promises are fulfilled, Cardano will still have to face the difficult challenge of attracting developers. The point is not only to be a high-quality blockchain but also to be a used one, a blockchain on which something is actually built.</p>
<h2>Cardano decentralization</h2>
<p>Some media mention Cardano as the most decentralized cryptocurrency. Even compared to Bitcoin. More than 70% of existing Cardano wallets already take part in the so-called staking provided by the network. In addition, this number is expected to continue to grow. It is also important to add that even this fact is not enough for the authors of Cardano. This is because the so-called parameter K will be modified, which will lead to the fact that all ADA pools that verify transactions will be equal. The security of the network will be, therefore, fairly distributed among all participants.</p>
<h2>PoS and Cardano critique</h2>
<p>Critics of Proof of Stake consensus on Cardano have one strong argument. <em>How will it be possible to prevent strong players from operating, for example, 30% of all pools?</em>
 The thing is, that decentralization can be cleverly distributed among 1,000 different pools within a code, but no one can guarantee that a third of them will not actually be run by one or a few strong entities. Such a risk is mainly posed by large crypto exchanges, and it is therefore recommended that cryptocurrency holders do not "stack" their coins through stock exchanges, but through their own wallets, thus contributing to decentralization.</p>
<p>It is true that trying to conclude which cryptocurrency is best in terms of decentralization is a tough nut to crack. With Bitcoin, elements of decentralization can be seen in its mining. There are only a few important mining pools and in addition, a significant part of mining (more than 50 %) is concentrated in China. So which cryptocurrency is ultimately more decentralized? Bitcoin with several large mining pools, to which miners from all over the world join and delegate their mining power, or Cardano with a thousand different pools that are equal, but at risk of some possible large part of them being under the control of several strong players?</p>
<h2>Cardano stands on an academic foundation</h2>
<p>What is undoubtedly interesting about the Cardano is the fact that it is based on strong academic foundations and on works that have been published in several respected scientific magazines. You could even say that everything that has been and will be built on this blockchain has its roots in the mathematical verification of whether the overall solution can really work or not. After all, the reason for the slower development of Cardano in recent years can be found in the final conclusion of the developers. Which claimed that the original concept was not correct, and therefore a lot of things had to be redone.</p>
<p>Leading cryptographers and several university professors from prestigious universities are involved in the development of Cardano. This all sounds nice, but sometimes investors in ADA coins are hesitant about whether such a thorough and slow process is really necessary. Will Cardano miss its boat because of that? The authors believe not. According to them, it is a long-distance run and they are currently at the start. According to them, it will be important to fight through this race and deliver a product that will work for decades to come.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Let us sum it up. The riskiness of investing in Cardano lies mainly in the fact that not all the promised phases have been completed yet. We still have the era of Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire, which are to ensure the arrival of smart contracts, faster scalability of the network, and its decentralized management.</p>
<p>The question remains whether the smart contracts of Cardano will really be as great as they claim to be and whether the speed of the network will really handle the arrival of potentially hundreds of millions of people. If so, Cardano has huge potential to succeed, but if promises are not kept, it could be a failed investment.</p>

<Excerpt>Among the most significant cryptocurrencies by market capitalization is the Cardano project, found by Charles Hoskinson, former co-founder of the Ethereum cryptocurrency. It is Ethereum that Cardano has the ambition to compete with in the future. In this article, we will walk you through the basic features of this ambitious project, built on strong academic foundations.</Excerpt>

<Title>Which 3 oils are traded the most? </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>First is <strong>West Texas Intermediate (WTI)</strong>
 is a crude oil of extremely high quality and because of this property, it is possible to extract more gasoline from a single barrel compared with most other crude oils traded on the market. The WTI has an API gravity  of 39.6 degrees, which gives the oil the characteristic of “light”; moreover the concentration of 0.24 percent of sulfur makes it a “sweet” crude oil.Those qualities together with the extraction location, make the WTI the prime crude oil refined within the United States, which is the largest gasoline consuming country on the?planet. The vast amount of the WTI is refined mainly in the Gulf Coast and in the Midwest regions.?Because of its characteristic, the WTI crude oil, is usually priced higher than the other two main traded oil: respectively $5-7 per barrel higher than the OPEC basket and $1-2 more than the “Brent Blend”.</p>
<p>The term “API Gravity” refers to the “American Petroleum Institute Gravity, and it is a measure that analyzes how heavy or light the oil is compared to the water. If an oil shows an “API Gravity” value greater than 10, then the crude oil will float on the water being lighter. If an oil “API Gravity” is below 10, it means that the crude oil is heavier than water and therefore will sink.</p>
<p>Second, <strong>Brent Blend</strong>
  is a combination of different types of crude oils, which are extracted from 15 fields throughout the Nynas system, located in the North Sea, and the Scottish Brent. The</p>
<p><em>“API Gravity” of this particular oil is 38.3 degrees: this characteristic makes it a “light” oil similar to the WTI, but not as much as the WTI. In the same way, the quantity of sulfur contained (0.37 percent), makes it a “sweet” crude oil, but not as “sweet” as the WTI.</em>
</p>
<p>Brent Blend properties make this crude oil excellent for the production of gasoline and middle distillates, which are most used in North-West Europe. As for the WTI, the production of the Brent is in a declining trend, but remains one of the major benchmarks to analyze the price of crude oils both in Europe and in Africa. Usually the price of the Brent is approximately $4/barrel higher than the OPEC Basket price and $1-2 lower than the WTI.</p>
<p>And the last one is <strong>OPEC Basket Oil</strong>
 price. This is a weighted average of prices for petroleum blends produced by OPEC countries. The basket is composed of 11 different types of crude oils from Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Venezuela, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, UAE and Angola. The acronym OPEC means “Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries” which is an organization that was created in 1960 to generate common policies for the production quotas and the sale prices among its members.</p>
<p>Compared with the WTI and the Brent Blend, the OPEC oil contains a higher percentage of sulfur and therefore is not as “sweet” as these oils; moreover, the OPEC oil is not naturally “light” as the WTI or Brent. Because of these two reasons, the quantity of gasoline that is possible to extract from this oil is lower, thus the prices of OPEC oil are normally lower than the WTI or Brent.</p>

<Title>What is a Moving Average (MA) indicator? </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The moving average (MA) is the average of the time series data (observations equidistant in time) from several consecutive periods. Moving averages are called “mobile," because it is constantly being re-calculated every time new data is available. It advances by eliminating the oldest value and adding the most recent value . For example, the six-month moving average of prices can be calculated by averaging the prices from January to June, then the average of sales from February to July, then March to August, and so on.</p>
<p>The main purposes of moving averages are:</p>
<p>•	reducing the effect of temporary differences of the data.</p>
<p>•	improving the "fit" of data from a line (a process called 'smoothing' ) to show more clearly the trend of the data.</p>
<p>•	highlighting any value above or below the trend.</p>
<p>When a moving average has a positive slope and the price is above it, this is considered as an indicator of an uptrend. In contrast, an average slope downward with a price that lies below the MA can mean a signal of a downward trend.</p>
<p>The moving average is more like a follower rather than a leader: its signals occur after the new movement, event, or when a trend has begun, not before. Therefore, it could lead to a market entry with a lag.</p>
<p>Although the daily closing price is the price most commonly used to calculate the simple moving average, the average can also be based on the midrange level or on a daily average of the maximum, minimum or opening price.</p>
<p>The period of the moving averages can be decided according to need: by choosing a longer period, the average will tend to behave less sensitively to the change of a single value, while with a shorter period, the moving average will be more affected by the single movement of the price.</p>
<p>Example of MA below:</p>

<Excerpt>Moving averages (MA) are one of the most versatile and most used indicators in the whole field of technical analysis because, thanks to the construction method of the indicator, moving averages are very easy both to test and adapt.</Excerpt>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: xDai - A functional scaling solution for Ethereum</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What is xDai?</h2>
<p>It is a network of multiple layers. First, it is a DPoS blockchain. Which is an abbreviation for Delegated proof of stake. This means that the network has a limited number of validators and other network participants cooperate in its operation by delegating their coins to specific validators.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is a network compatible with Ethereum. This means that it supports the same programming language (Solidity), supports token standards, and is practically something like a sister blockchain to Ethereum, although the application differs.</p>
<p>Thirdly, xDai is the so-called 2nd layer of Ethereum. xDai is not supposed to be a blockchain on its own, but a blockchain that is supposed to lighten the primary chain, and the value of the xDai network (ie the value of the STAKE coin) ultimately derives from this.</p>
<h2>Why is xDai necessary?</h2>
<p>Charges on the Ethereum network rose to astronomical levels during the last hype. It was common to pay a transaction fee of five dollars. If you interacted with smart contracts (such as Uniswap), the fees climbed up to $ 30 per operation.</p>
<p>Therefore, scaling solutions are needed. And that is exactly xDai. The competition in this area is relatively high and is developing rapidly, which is a factor to consider when buying STAKE. There are many scaling solutions for Ethereum. These are various variations of rollups, second-layer networks such as Matic, Loopring, Celer, and others, Plasma (similar to the Lightning network), and finally the upcoming launch of ETH 2.0.</p>
<p>The basic value in this area will be user-friendliness and easy solution implementation for developers.</p>
<h2>xDai coins: xDai and Stake</h2>
<p>One of the confusing things about the xDai network is the unconventional architecture in relation to token / coin policy. The xDai network has practically two native coins.</p>
<p><strong>XDai works as a network fuel</strong>
. This is a stablecoin derived from the Dai token, which generates the MakerDAO protocol.</p>
<p>xDai is thus a converted version of stablecoin, which forms the native currency on the xDai network. The fuel for transactions is thus in the form of a stable token generated by another, decentralized service. If you want to work on the xDai network, you must have Dai coins on the ETH network and then convert them to xDai.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/whyxdai_72c593fefc.jpg" alt="Advantages of xDai token">
<span class="img-caption">Figure1: Main traits of xDai coin</span>
<p>The second coin that is the primary interest of this analysis is STAKE. <strong>STAKE is a coin of the xDai network, which ensures the operation of the network itself</strong>
. This means that delegators and validators deal primarily with STAKE coins. If you want to participate in the operation of the network, you need STAKE.</p>
<p>By locking the STAKE coin, you can participate in the consensus of the network. In return, delegators, and validators are rewarded with newly issued STAKE coins.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/multichain_2003c078a6.jpg" alt="Multichain staking on Stake token">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Multichain staking</span>
<p>However, also STAKE has added value. Due to the fact that from the design’s perspective it is a second-layer chain, the price proposition for holding STAKE must be stronger than, for example, for classic smart chains such as ETH, Polkadot, or Cosmos.</p>
<p>STAKE holders will thus be rewarded with intelligent network architecture. The xDai network is also connected to the defi Chai application, which basically offers interest for holding a DAI (interest is based on holding the stability of a DAI token).</p>
<p>The whole system works in such a way that the DAIs in the smart contract on the ETH side are automatically converted to CHAI (double lock) and then participate in maintaining a stable DAI exchange rate, for which they receive interest (or rather a stability fee). These rewards are then distributed to STAKE coin holders in the form of xDAI stablecoin.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the DPoS network, network charges are rather insignificant. However, small fees are fees nevertheless and they will also go to STAKE owners, so this is another income that validators and delegators will have.</p>
<h2>Understanding the Stake price development</h2>
<p>STAKE has not been on the market for a long time. In its short existence, the price has created two accumulation zones. The first accumulation zone was between $ 3 and $ 5. If the market would fall radically, this price would again come into play. However, in the case of continued growth, we could count on the second accumulation zone, which is between $ 10 and $ 14.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/Stakeprice_9846c5146d.png" alt="STAKE price development">
<span class="img-caption">Figure3: STAKE price analysis</span>
<p>As you can see in the chart, we are still correcting after the growth and the declining trend is not over yet, as the moving averages show. So far, it is not at all clear whether the decline will continue or whether the support will remain at ten dollars.</p>
<p>In the case of an ascending market, the rise of STAKE as one of the representatives of DEFI can also be expected.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The stake is a combination of several different products from the blockchain world. It is a scaling solution for Ethereum, which deeply integrates into itself individual services from decentralized finances.</p>
<p>The main goal is to become the Ethereum payment network. Low fees enable highly efficient network operation. The lack of decentralization (DPoS is a structurally worse option in this respect compared to PoS or PoW) does not matter so much, given that the network serves as a payment and application layer.</p>
<p>STAKE has one major problem to tackle down, and that is the complex access path. The user must convert DAI tokens to access xDAI in order to pay transaction fees on the other side. Although the bridge between xDai and ETH is trivial, for many users the current transition can be more complicated, and if individual applications and wallets integrated xDai with a single click, xDAI could become a high-value network.</p>
<p>It is also important to monitor the competition because the key is to find a scaling solution that is really being used. XDai has an advantage in this because the hardcore of the community around decentralized finances already knows about it.</p>
<p>While investing in STAKE is highly risky, it also makes sense in relation to the current state of the crypto space. STAKE is one of the few functional scaling solutions for ETH and that means something.</p>

<Excerpt>One of the key issues in the crypto space is called the blockchain trilemma. It is a problem where it is not possible to create a blockchain that has three key properties. Speed, security, and decentralization. This affects virtually all blockchains. Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralized, secure networks, but they are painfully slow. And that is what scaling channels aspire to solve. One of them being the xDai network, which aims to create essentially a second layer for Ethereum. Today we will look at how xDai works, why it looks promising, and what must happen for the xDai network to be one of the successful projects.</Excerpt>

<Title>The Norwegian giant bought $ 58 million worth of Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p><strong>According to a press release, the Seetee unit will focus on:</strong>
</p>
<li>Investing and owning Bitcoin</li>
<li>Engaging in blockchain communities and establishing significant partnerships with leading representatives of this sector</li>
<li>Launching own BTC operations</li>
<li>Building and investing in innovative projects and companies in the BTC ecosystem</li>
<p>Seetee has already made its first investment of $ 58.5 million by purchasing 1,170 BTC.</p>
<span class="post-quote">“Bitcoin is our underlying asset. Our strategy is HODL"</span>
<span class="quote-author">The Seetee company press release after confirming the purchase of the first BTC</span>
<p>The company also indicated that it will focus on bitcoin mining itself. While also confirming its partnership with the important player in this field - BlockStream.</p>
<h2>What led to the transition to Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>The CEO of Seetee, Kjell Inge Røkke, is considered one of the wealthiest Norwegians with an estimated $ 3.6 billion worth of assets. In a letter to shareholders, he announced that the decision to invest in Bitcoin was the result of long and substantial negotiations at the company level.</p>
<p>Røkke mentioned that he became interested in Bitcoin in the summer of 2020 and spent a lot of time studying this cryptocurrency. He read dozens of books, hundreds of articles, videos and listened to many podcasts. Of course, there were also countless interviews and analyzes that he has gone through.</p>
<p>Among the people who influenced his opinion on Bitcoin were Saifedean Aammous, author of "The Bitcoin Standard", Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Adam Back, Chamath Palihapitiya, and last but not least, Michael Saylor, who launched the institutional purchase of Bitcoin in the United States through Microstrategy.</p>
<span class="post-quote">“Bitcoin can still drop to zero. However, it can also become the core of the monetary infrastructure, and if it does, one bitcoin can be worth a million dollars.”
</span>
<span class="quote-author">Kjell Inge Røkke</span>

<Title>EUR/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.44%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.45%</strong>
, respectively. Yesterday´s return was <strong>-0.60%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently <strong>-1</strong>
 for the month-on-month change and <strong>-1</strong>
 for price indexation. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210309_Cycles_5a6e2a6ec4.jpg" alt="Price indextaion and estimated cycles">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Walfir </span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. <strong>EUR/USD</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment in the case of monthly and 6-month MAs and still in bullish sentiment according to the annual MA, as we can see in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: Walfir </span>
<p>There have been upward and downward trends that have not exceeded more than 3 consecutive days since November. To estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions, we could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range), obtained from daily data. The current value is <strong>0.76%</strong>
 . Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1%</strong>
 and <strong>1%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle. To estimate Profit Targets, we could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.25%</strong>
), which is shown in the second chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: Walfir </span>
<p>Basic technical analysis supports bearish sentiment after a day at high volumes (red ellipse). However, <strong>EUR/USD</strong>
 is currently in the demand zone (green rectangle) with a strong bottom, where the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>38.20%</strong>
 is. In addition, the longer-term MA is also close to the exchange rate. The divergence between price development and RSI could also motivate short-term bulls and bring the upward rebound to a psychological level of <strong>1.2000.</strong>

<Excerpt>The current price of the EUR/USD exchange rate is 1.1901 (March 09, 2021). The decline of this pair has slowed down today, and we will look at statistical and technical analysis.</Excerpt>

<Title>Xpeng Inc. - The pullback is likely</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h1>Xpeng Inc.</h1>
<p>Xpeng Inc is a Smart Electric Vehicle company designing, developing, manufacturing, and marketing smart electric vehicles in China. The company manufactures environmentally-friendly vehicles, namely an SUV (the G3) and a four-door sports sedan (the P7). It targets the mid-to-high-end segment in China's passenger vehicle market.</p>
<p>This hot EV stock is a new competitor for Tesla in the USA and NIO in China. The chart looks like an EV boom is over, but there could be a substantial opportunity in the mid to long-term. The Q4/2020 was powerful as the company beat top revenue estimates (436 mil USD vs. 404 mil USD estimates). In our estimation based on calculation, we aimed at a conservative target of 428 mil USD. EPS is much harder to count accurately because it can have extraordinary costs, which would highly impact EPS. For this reason, we aim at "revenue targeting."</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/q4_calculation_cf11a207d4.png" alt="Financial calculations of Xpengs company">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Author's calculation</span>
<p>The company delivered strong growth, where Year-Over-Year (YoY) revenue increase in 2020 was 151.8%. Car model P7 Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ) increased more than 37%. The company still has negative EPS but is expected to deliver substantial gains in 2021. Its balance sheet looks very strong as there are very liquid assets and small current liabilities. The company has enough current assets "as a startup" so it could face worsening financial conditions for some time without bigger damage. However, the demand is still robust for EV and its products.</p>

<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/chart_554b8fd047.png" alt="Graph of XPENG stocks price with indicators">
<span class="img-caption">Souce: Tradingview</span>
<p>Xpeng is in an extraordinary situation. In some statistical cases, the company has never been trading in current oversold conditions. Many factors: RSI ultra oversold, EMA spread between slow and fast-moving averages is extraordinary high, and so on. There are six consecutively weekly declines and five consecutively 3Days declines. The company tested the price of its first trading day on the CBOE market exchange from September and filled many gaps. There are some bullish narratives in the short term:  Q4 revenue beat, Q1/2021 reliable guidance, and the latest one is the news for XPENG, NIO, and LI - should be added to the Hong-Kong stock exchange in the first half of 2021. Xpeng is still very oversold but is gaining positive momentum in the short-term. However, if the future price somehow hit 60 USD, we could ask about fair valuation (overvaluation).</p>

<Title>Can blockchain help in healthcare?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<span class="post-quote">“By decentralizing patient health history, tracking pharmaceuticals, and improving payment options, blockchain is becoming a valuable tool for healthcare, revolutionizing the industry worldwide.”</span>
<span class="quote-author">Brian Weinberg</span>
<p>Brian Weinberg is one of an emerging technologies journalist,  he lists fourteen major use cases, and four of them are demonstrated in the article below, that are envisaged to overhaul the healthcare system.</p>
<p><strong>Improving medical records:</strong>
 MedRec’s blockchain (in collaboration with MIT Media Lab and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation) allows different health providers and pharma-ceutical companies to share patients’ medical records from the blockchain ledger as a single source of truth. This way, when a patient uses a certain health provider and then switches to another one, it becomes easy for the new provider to know the full medical history of the patient. The project is in the testing stage.</p>
<p><strong>Cutting cost, saving time, and enhancing connectivity between providers:</strong>
 SimplyVital Health developed two blockchain-based applications (ConnectingCare and Health Nexus) that help providers to enhance processes and cut cost.</p>
<p><strong>Improving medical record-keeping:</strong>
 through a collaboration between Taipei Medical Uni-versity and Digital Treasury Corporation, a blockchain project named phrOS is finalized and running. The project claims to be the world’s first hospital-wide blockchain integration project that aims to tap into the benefits of health data sharing while ensuring data privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing the security and control of healthcare transactions:</strong>
 Change Healthcare company announced its enterprise-scale blockchain in the claims management system. Neil de Crescenzo, the president, and chief executive officer of the company, says, "We are excited to work with customers and partners on applying blockchain technology to improve how pa-yers and providers interact and conduct business, starting with the revenue cycle and pay-ment process". The company says that its blockchain already processes 50 million transactions daily.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: CISION </span>
<p>Blockchain attracted the attention of not only enterprises and venture capitalists, but also major public agencies. The U.S. Food & Drug Administration, for example, has an open eye on the blockchain, especially in the supply chain process. In a press release dated February 07, 2019, the agency announced that it is engaging in a pilot project that is “… intended to assist FDA and members of the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain in the development of the electronic, interoperable system that will identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed within the United States.”</p>

<Excerpt>The healthcare sector is one of the most important areas where blockchain is expected to add tangible value. The technology is foreseen to utterly redefine processes in the sector.</Excerpt>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Technical Analysis of Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Technical analysis is basically just probability and statistics. Sometimes there are situations where there is a huge probability that the charts will go in a certain direction, other times there are multiple options at once. And today it is the latter of the two.</p>
<h2>New all-time high</h2>
<p>The first option is quite simple - Bitcoin will go to a new maximum which would indicate that correction is over. This option is proving increasingly likely because we have already witnessed a double top. The chart and the price have not yet been rejected, even though we can already see signs of weakness on the indicators, however, the price level has not yet fallen.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_an_1_05d8d79195.png" alt="First possible Bitcoin price development scenario is new all-time high">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: First possible scenario of Bitcoin price development</span>
<h2>Triangle</h2>
<p>The second option is that the correction is not over yet and we will be witnessing a side trend for some time, but without falling to a new low. In this case, the market most often goes into a correction in the form of a triangle. Since the growth has been so significant up to this point, it would probably be an ascending triangle, from which the price would then dart to a new maximum.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_an_2_ba989351ee.png" alt="Second possible price development on Bitcoin could lead to a triangle formation">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Second possible price development on Bitcoin could lead to a triangle formation</span>
<h2>ABC correction</h2>
<p>The most bearish option that comes into consideration is the ABC correction. In this case, the price would already be moving around the top with decline waiting for us around the corner. With the ABC correction, a new low or at least a double bottom could easily occur.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_an_3_4e77e26625.png" alt="Third possible alternative to Bitcoin price development is ABC correction">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 3: Third possible alternative to Bitcoin price development is ABC correction</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There are currently several options regarding the Bitcoin price development. In this situation, one of three scenarios may occur. Unfortunately, we do not currently know which one. Personally, I think that the longer the price consolidates around the top, the more likely it will eventually break to a new high.</p>

<Title>Gold - The bottom could be behind us</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h1>Gold - The bottom could be behind us</h1>
<p>In February, we saw a significant drop in gold price on the stock exchange. The most crucial factor that caused this decline was the growth of yields on the bond market. The relationship is simple, as yields on US government bonds rise, precious metals, even the stock market, tend to weaken. On the contrary, if long-term bond yields fall again, we can expect growth in precious metals. It is not the only factor, but the key one.</p>
<h2>US Bond Yields</h2>
<p>US government bond yields, as we have mentioned, have grown significantly in recent weeks. The US dollar has strengthened recently, which also did not play into the carat of precious metals. In the financial market, many things affect each other, such as high yields, strengthening the US dollar, which in turn negatively affects the prices of precious metals.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/yieldy_b4c10d7ae5.png" alt="Yield of 10US Government bond">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Tradingview</span>
<p>Yields on 10-year US government bonds currently have a yield of 1,612%. This is almost from pre-pandemic levels in January 2020, not forgetting that monetary policy has changed diametrically. US primary interest rates are still at or slightly above zero. Revenue is growing mainly for the following reasons:
•	there is a relatively rapid economic recovery, and therefore investors sell bonds and buy riskier assets,
•	the second possibility is that another fiscal stimulus of USD 1.9 trillion will cause significant inflationary pressures, which we see in reality, and so yields are starting to increase.</p>
<h2>Comparison with "new" M2 money</h2>
<p>Finally, I would like to draw attention to the amount of money issued in the US during 2020 and 2021. If we look at the price of gold that we have divided by M2, we get a coefficient that we can observe from a historical point of view.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/koeficient_s_M2_0c195f1385.png" alt="Indicator Gold/M2">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Tradingview</span>
<p>As the number of money in the economy continues to grow and gold is a limited supply commodity. Given this, it is impressive why such a correction occurs. I will address a specific reason next time, but at current levels compared to M2, gold is "relatively cheap" in the long-term perspective.</p>
<h2>"Managed money are selling"</h2>
<p>From this point of view, I will quote one person on Twitter, who is explaining what is going on "Managed money" market from the Commitments of Traders (COT) report:
"<em>Highlights from this week's Commitments of Traders (COT) report for gold. 'Managed Money' traders have reduced their relative long position to nearly the bottom of their historical range. Usually, these lows mark bottoms in the gold price</em>
. "(Chris Rutherglen, check source <a href="https://twitter.com/CRutherglen/status/1370532494844387333">here)</a>
.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: Chris Rutherglen's Twitter.</span>
<h2>Average development in February and March vs. current development</h2>
<p>This chart also shows that if we follow a short horizon or rise into position at the wrong time, investing in gold can also be risky. Below we can see the average development of gold for February and March (blue) for the last 20 years in February and March, and in contrast, we can see the current price development. The gold price has weakened by about 10% since the beginning of gold and is currently well below average.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/feb_march_average_vs_current_76661c618e.PNG" alt="February and March average development vs. current price of gold">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Author's calculation</span>
<p>As we mentioned, the price of gold in the current months is affected by many factors. If yields continue to rise, we can expect worse developments in the price of gold. If the situation reverses, precious metals will likely grow. From a statistical and technical point of view, gold is very oversold. Yields are increasing globally, not only in the US market. In some countries, central banks have already intervened through higher purchases of assets (bonds) to push the yield curve to lower levels and thus reduce the cost of debt and credit.</p>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: Reef Finance and 20-million-dollar investment </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>More than 20 million dollars from trading firm</h2>
<p>According to the news released on Friday, Reef Finance got a major investment boost from Alameda Research, which invested more than 20 million dollars into the development of this DeFi project. The investment was done via purchase of REEF tokens and was met with 25 % price boom of REEF over the course of 24 hours.</p>
<p>Alameda Research is young quantitative trading firm that is mostly concerned about investing and trading digital assets. The company manages more than 100 million dollars in digital assets and trades up to 1,5 billion dollars per day across thousands of products. Having support from Alameda Research is definitely great for Reef Finance, since it increases the credibility of the project as well as helps with resources thus providing more space to grow for the young DeFi project.</p>
<p>Reef Finance has therefore yet another interesting investor and supporter. Alameda Research is joining company of Genesis Block, Bitcoin.com, TRG Capital or Master Ventures, which have already invested or supported Reef Finance. CEO of Reef Finance was obviously very pleased with this news.</p>
<span class="post-quote">“We are excited to incorporate this investment to further our trajectory and for the development of the Reef chain for DeFi applications of the future.” </span>
<span class="quote-author">Reef Finance CEO Denko Mancheski</span>
<p>Moreover, according to the sources close to Reef Finance, Alameda Research might be prone to more investments in the future, which is one of the reasons why Reef Finance should be included into the watchlist of all true DeFi lovers and supporters.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Reef Finance is yet another DeFi project that you might want to add to your watchlist. Even though the whole DeFi sector might be in a bit of a mania or a bubble now, the future of decentralised finance is definitely bright. Reef Finance (REEF) is one of the more important projects that even got a huge recognition in form of a significant investment.</Excerpt>

<Title>Ethereum: Important fee update ‘EIP-1559‘ scheduled for July</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The highly anticipated upgrade to the Ethereum network is expected to affect transaction fees. Ethereum could thus become a deflationary asset. In July 2021, Ethereum is scheduled for a hardfork called London.</p>
<span class="post-quote">"I guess we are in the right position to be prepared for the upgrade." </span>
<span class="quote-author">Tim Beiko, ETH's chief developer.</span>
<p>The proposal, co-authored by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, is said to transform the fee structure and change 2 important things.</p>
<p>Transaction fees will not go to the miners now but will be burned instead, creating ETH token deflation. After the introduction of EIP-1559, only voluntary "tips" from users who entered the transaction will go to the miners. The “burned fee” is determined algorithmically, which should make it easier for users to pay a fee that is fair.</p>
<p>Transaction fees are standardized for the entire network and their amount is adjusted according to the current network load. The question remains whether this will work once the upgrade is implemented.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Ethereum is scheduled for important fee update ‘EIP-1559‘ in July</span>
<h2>Ethereum mining as a golden opportunity</h2>
<p>Lately, Ethereum mining has been a very interesting opportunity. According to Coin Metrics, mining revenues exceeded a record of a staggering $ 1.3 billion in February, with 50% coming from fees alone. The increase in price and transaction fees has led to an increase in hash power, which has more than doubled since last year.</p>
<p>Recent research has revealed that EIP-1559 could burn 1 million Ether in one year, which represents almost 1% of the whole network. Inflation-reduced ethereum will also gain a deflationary element that could become attractive to both new and existing investors.</p>
<h2>Supporters and critics</h2>
<p>Everything has its pros and cons and the same goes for EIP-1559. This proposal is highly supported by developers on one side with miners on the other, criticizing the fact that they will lose a substantial amount of money. There were threats of a hard fork, with estimated losses ranging up to 50%. Eventually, these threats passed, hopefully leaving these pointless mining practices in the past.</p>
<p>Ethereum mining pool Flexpool has launched a marketing campaign against EIP-1559. Several smaller pools joined, supported by larger pools such as Bitfly and Sparkpool. This made up over 60% of the hashing force going against the EIP-1559 design. The third-largest pool, F2Pool (11.4%), expressed support for this proposal despite the fact that it will mean a record loss in its income.</p>
<p>A recent Grayscale study identified the EIP-1559 as an important upgrade with great potential for increasing ETH.</p>

<Excerpt>While users and investors rejoice in this report that EIP-1559 is scheduled for July, ETH miners are not quite as thrilled. Nonetheless, that did not prevent developers from planning this update.</Excerpt>

<Title>GBP/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately  <strong>0.43%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.43%</strong>
, respectively. Yesterday´s return was <strong>-0.15%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently neutral <strong>(0)</strong>
 for the month-on-month change and <strong>-2</strong>
 for price indexation. . Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. An indexation bottom below <strong>-0.8</strong>
 could be an opportunity for bulls. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210316_Cycles_3c7981528a.jpg" alt="Price indextaion and estimated cycles">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. <strong>GBP/USD</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment in the case of monthly MA, after falling below it. As we can see in the chart below, the 6 months and annual MAs are still in bullish sentiment..</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since September 2020, there have been upward trends that have not exceeded more than <strong>4</strong>
 consecutive days. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>2</strong>
 days in the same period. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.85%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.71%</strong>
 . Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1%</strong>
 and <strong>1%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle. We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the second chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports bullish sentiment, as the exchange rate creates higher lows and higher high. However, <strong>EUR/USD</strong>
 is currently also close to the demand zone (green rectangle) with a strong bottom, where the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>38.20%</strong>
 is. In addition, the shorter-term MA has also recently been very close to the exchange rate. Volumes are slowing down. The divergence between price development and RSI could also motivate short-term bulls and bring the upward rebound to a psychological level of <strong>1.4000</strong>
 or even higher to <strong>1.4200.</strong>

<Title>Kirkland Lake Gold - Undervalued Gold Producer</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Kirkland Lake Gold Ltd is a Canada-based gold mining, development, and exploration company with a diversified portfolio of exploration projects. The company's production profile includes the Macassa mine complex located in northeastern Ontario and the Fosterville gold mine located in the State of Victoria, Australia. Also, the company owns the Holt mine and the Detour mine. The company's mines and material mineral projects are located in Canada and Australia.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/TW_KL_ab6f59746d.png" alt="KL and gold comparison">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Patrik Mackovych. Tradingview.</span>
<p>According to the price of the primary metal that the company targets - gold, the stock should be traded a few percent higher. In the previous swing cycle, at a similar gold price, KL has recently traded 10-15% higher. This producer has a strong financial position, as it has only a minimum of liabilities vs. assets. We can say with a clear conscience that the situation is so intense that even if the price of gold fell below USD 1000 for a few months, we could say that it would not go bankrupt.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the company has AISC (all-in sustaining costs) at a low $ 790 / 1oz. Compared to the competition, this is a deficient number; many others and large producers have an AISC of 800-1000 $ / 1oz. Therefore, it can be said that it has a competitive advantage and a higher margin compared to other companies in the industry. The company has no debt, only a small portion of liabilities. It has a sufficiently high amount of cash, and the company invests in research and development. Compared to last year, the company increased production and, thanks to the price of gold, reported an increase in sales of 78%.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/profit_2020_42de1843da.png" alt="KL's earnings report in 2020">
<span class="img-caption">Source: KL's earnings report.</span>
<p>The balance sheet also looks very healthy. Current assets are almost double those of short-term liabilities, and total assets are more than three times the total liabilities.</p>
<h2>Guidance</h2>
<p>The 3-year outlook looks optimistic, although it provides less room for revenue growth. In any case, it should be recalled that the company is without significant short-term and long-term debt. This production amount represents a solid future free cash flow, which should be significantly reflected in the share price, but mainly depend on gold's price.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: KL's presentation for investors.</span>
<h2>Valuations</h2>
<p>The company is constantly growing, although the outlook for the coming years shows much lower revenue growth than we saw in 2020. We expect that the company's asset component and its book value will continue to grow significantly, which should again be reflected in its shares. KL should also have enough cash for additional buybacks and dividend increases in the future. In 4Q / 2020, the dividend increased by $ 0.18, growing steadily every year. Kirkland Lake Gold repurchased 18,925,900 of its shares in 2020.</p>
<p>P/E: 11.10
P/B: 1.76
P/FCF: 12.02</p>

<Title>Fundament of the week: How do crypto wallets work?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Introduction to crypto wallets</h2>
<p>A <strong>Bitcoin wallet</strong>
, the same as any other crypto wallet, always consists of two parts. The first part is the <strong>public key</strong>
 (also called the public address), which can be shared with other users. The second part is the <strong>private key</strong>
, which must <strong>never be revealed to the public</strong>
. Likewise, the wallet consists of a pair of cryptographic keys. A public Bitcoin address can be compared to an email address, while your private key can be compared to your password.</p>
<p>The private key is used to encrypt transactions, while the public key is used to decrypt them. That is why the private key must be kept secure. <strong>Anyone with access to a private key is also the owner of the wallet, it is the same as if they had access to your bank account password</strong>
. The public key is used for sharing with third parties and as proof that you are the owner of the Bitcoin address. In other words - the public key is like your bank account number - IBAN.</p>
<p>The combination of private and public keys creates a <strong>digital signature</strong>
. It is a special type of digital cryptography that aims to create a secure digital link to the identity of the crypto wallet owner. Digital signatures prove your ownership and allow you to control your property.</p>
<p>The crypto-wallet can therefore be a piece of paper with information written on it. It will simply contain a public and private key, written in plain text with the appropriate QR codes. That is all you need for the safe storage of cryptocurrencies. They cannot be saved in one place, such as a digital file on a USB drive. All information about them is stored in a <em>decentralized block</em>
 managed by thousands of people around the world. The very nature of digital files predetermines them for effortless and indefinite copying.</p>
<p>Filmmakers and musicians have been facing this problem since the arrival of the Internet and peer-to-peer technology. Should cryptocurrencies worked on a similar principle, the whole system would have collapsed like a house of cards. Anyone could create new coins on the go without any restrictions. This is exactly what blockchain technology prevents from happening. Whenever you try to send bitcoin, blockchain miners are checking if the required quantity can be sent. In other words, <strong>miners check the entire history of your transactions</strong>
 because your bitcoins are not stored in a single physical location.</p>
<h2>Types of crypto wallets</h2>
<p><strong>Crypto wallets are divided into 2 basic categories:</strong>
</p>
<h3>Hot wallets - constantly connected to the internet</h3>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>
 - These wallets are usually provided by various online services that also allow cryptocurrency trading. As a result, you can easily and quickly perform a practically unlimited number of transactions. Online wallets are usually very cheap or even free (because they are often open-source). Mobile wallets can be very convenient because most people today own smartphones. They are easy to use when making transactions, as you only need to use the phone's camera to scan the QR codes of the address of receiving the crypto wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>
 - A wallet that is permanently connected to the Internet. However, it has one very obvious weakness - it is vulnerable to hacker attacks. Hot wallets as such are not suitable for the long-term storage of cryptocurrencies. Unless you fully trust the providers of the service that offers the crypto wallet.</p>
<h3>Cold wallets - offline</h3>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>
 - These wallets are not connected to the Internet, which makes them very secure for long-term storage. The wallet only connects to the Internet when you send cryptocurrencies. You do not need an internet connection to receive them, because as the receiving party you do not have to confirm the transaction. The transaction is performed in the blockchain network, where the entire transaction history of your wallet is stored. The sender only needs to know your public address. Thanks to this, cryptocurrencies are also ideal as a form of a gift. Another advantage is that you can get a crypto-wallet for free if you decide to use the paper version we mentioned previously.</p>
<p><strong>Cons</strong>
 - Just as you must defrost frozen food before consumption, you must first connect the cold wallet to your computer before using it. This makes the whole process a bit longer. In addition, beginners may have problems with the setup process. Another potential disadvantage is that hardware wallets can be expensive, but the price is derived from an additional level of security.</p>
<h3>Another 4 basic subcategories</h3>
<strong>Hardware wallets</strong>
<li> - public and private keys are stored on separate hardware devices and are written in digital form, access is locked and secured with a password.</li>
<strong>Paper wallets</strong>
<li> - public and private keys are written on paper (they can also be written on more durable material for longer storage)</li>
<strong>Online wallets</strong>
<li> (including mobile wallets) - Private keys are often owned by a wallet provider</li>
<strong>Software wallets</strong>
<li> - public and private keys are stored in a computer program and entered in digital form, while access is locked at least with a password</li>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Exchanges</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrencies on the stock exchange are also stored on wallets, but you only know their public addresses. Their private keys are stored by the cryptocurrency exchange. In reality, <strong>you do not have full control</strong>
 over your cryptocurrencies on the cryptocurrency exchange. If the servers are shut down or the cryptocurrency exchange services are blocked, you will not get to your cryptocurrencies. <strong>Therefore, in the long run, we recommend storing cryptocurrencies in wallets from which you own a private key.</strong>
</p>
<h3>What is "master code" or "seed"?</h3>
<p>It is very important to keep your master code (or seed) of your crypto wallet safe. We could also call the master code (seed) your <strong>main password</strong>
. This is the key to your cryptographic secrets and it is not just an ordinary password or PIN code. Rather, it is a combination of randomly selected words created by your device during the initial setup. If you lose access to your device, you can unlock access to your crypto-savings on another device of a similar type, but only with this combination of words.</p>
<p>The most commonly used standard is <strong>BIP 39</strong>
. As a result, your device uses a set of 2048 words to generate 2256 different combinations of 24-word master code. If this number doesn't seem that complex to you, or you find it difficult to imagine exponential numbers, then we will write it for you in its full form:</p>
<p>115, 792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007, - 913,49,45,684,97,129,639,984,97,129,639,984,97,129,639,936.</p>
<p>This is approximately 1,158x1077.</p>
<p>By comparison, the estimated number of all atoms on earth is 1050, so the chances of anyone guessing your master code and gaining access to your finances are astronomically low.</p>
<p>In any case, we recommend that you do your own research before choosing the right crypto wallet. Do not blindly follow any recommendations, not even our own. The <strong>research itself is a mantra</strong>
 that is often repeated in the crypto world, and this is especially true when we talk about the security of digital assets.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>If you want to use or trade any cryptocurrency, you will need to use a cryptocurrency wallet. It is a secure digital form of a classic wallet that is used to store, send and receive cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. Most cryptocurrencies have their own official wallets or recommend some of the wallets developed by third parties. In this article, you will learn how cryptocurrency wallets (crypto wallets) work.</Excerpt>

<Title>Fed does not want to control long term yield curve NOW</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h1>FED is extrelemy dovish</h1>
<p>On Wednesday, March 18, 2021, the US Federal Reserve had a “meeting.” The market had high expectations as long-term US bond yields continued to grow, given the expected economic recovery and rising inflation expectations. In any case, high yields cause the debt to be more expensive. This can be a problem for companies with a deteriorating financial position or for “startups” that show optimistic growth but still operate at a loss. The market was tense whether fed would ease monetary policy, even more, thereby reducing the cost of debt or adapting to a market that priced in fed funds increase in the future. However, we need to mention that fed is not buying US long-term debt in extreme ways yet; it targets the short-term curve right now.</p>
<h2>Fed and “dot-plot” prognosis</h2>
<p>The fed increased its volume through overnight reverse repo operations from $30 billion to $80 billion. According to Tavi Costa, the fed has increased the volume of asset purchases in recent weeks. This step should again raise inflation expectations.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: Tavi Costa (Crescat Capital LLC). Federal Reserve</span>
<p>On the following so-called “Dot-plot” chart, we can see how the fed decides to increase rates in the future. The number of points represents the number of votes of individual members who are entitled to vote. No US rate hike is expected this year. The vote partially reassured investors. On the other hand, significant changes need to be noted. At the previous Fed meeting, only one member of the commission voted to raise rates in 2022. As of March 17, 2020, there were already four members. On the left axis, we can see what change rates are leaning towards. In 2023, a more significant increase in rates to higher levels is expected. In our opinion, as we stated in December 2020, we expect a slight increase in rates in 2022, around the second half.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: Zerohedge. Federal Reserve.</span>
<p><strong>The head of the Fed, Powell, once again announced that the bond market’s current yields are not putting them in an uncomfortable position</strong>
. In doing so, they clearly declared that to some “turning point,” they would still accept an increase in yields on the bond market. After strong monetary and fiscal stimulus (a check of $ 1.9 trillion in March), we expect the economic recovery to come faster. We also expect significantly higher inflation in the US and an increase in employment. In this case, this may mean that bond yields may continue to rise due to a faster economic recovery and higher inflation. If we get to this point, it is clear that the fed will reconsider its monetary policy. <strong>In conclusion, we only remind you that higher yields have a negative impact on the growth of the price of precious metals and shares mostly with higher debt - the technology sector.</strong>
</p>

<p>However, we still consider yields growth to be limited. It should not be forgotten that higher bond yields = more expensive debt. In previous years we should see a similar pattern in yields. Every time it has been stopped, and the trend continued to lower. With the current monetary situation, we highly doubt about breaking previous highs from 2020. This could be seen if we had a massive inflation rally in 2021/2022.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Technical Analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>As for the daily chart, I am of the opinion that it is only a matter of time before the price rises. Bitcoin has been on the side trend for some time, but all indications suggest that it will rise again. As a target for a mid-term cycle, I set a value of $ 75,000 which I got by extrapolating it from the price level of the last growth.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is just below its all-time high and continues to go to the side. So far in the bullish cycle, this meant that we could witness growth. I think Bitcoin still needs to gain strength before it can grow, however. This sideways movement is just as good for the indicator. If BTC goes to the side, MA21 will temporarily approach the chart and act as support. The same can be said about the BK77.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: BTC Analysis on a daily chart</span>
<h2>4H chart</h2>
<p>As for the 4H chart, I like the declining volumes. It means that the chart goes to the side and something is going on. This only confirms my assumptions that after moving to the side, an upward movement could come. I see strong supports between $ 53,000 and $ 54,800 that have temporarily kept us in place. If the price will happen to go down, another strong support can be expected at $ 50,263.</p>
<p>I also marked the blue trend line on the chart. However, if the side movement will last longer, I might as well prepare a breakdown of this trend line for you. Should this breakdown be very sharp with volumes, we would have understood it as a disruption of the growth structure. On the contrary, if it is not sharp and without volumes, then we can accept it as a continuation of the movement to the side and the priority will continue to grow.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Bitcoin is very well prepared at this point, and the longer it goes sideways, the higher the chance that the break will come upwards.</p>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: Alchemix protocol</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>How does the Alchemix protocol work?</h2>
<p>Alchemix allows users to insert DAI stablecoins and mint "alUSD" from up to 50% of the inserted DAI. The DAI stored in Alchemix's smart contracts then goes to the Yearn finance vaults, where they can start generating profit immediately. Generated gains can then automatically start repaying debt incurred during the minting of DAI by using Alchemix.</p>
<p><strong>Here are 3 examples of how users can manage their open loan using Alchemix:</strong>
</p>
<li>Keep their deposit to earn revenue continuously, allowing them to draw up collateral on a regular basis.</li>
<li>Early repayment of the loan using alUSD or DAI, which will allow them to withdraw collateral.</li>
<li>Liquidation of their loan by repaying it using part of their savings, which then allows them to withdraw the rest of the balance</li>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/alchemix_protocol_fc70c8ffa4.png" alt="How Alchemix protocol works">
<span class="img-caption">Figue 1: Breakdown of Alchemix protocol</span>
<h2>What is alUSD?</h2>
<p>The term alUSD refers to the ERC-20 token on Ethereum, which will be tradable. When users mint their alUSD, they also have the option to save the alUSD back to a converter that can convert alUSD back to DAI and even to other stablecoins. Depending on various factors within the Alchemix ecosystem, this process can take varying lengths of time.</p>
<p>The team behind Alchemix also plans to build additional applications within the Alchemix ecosystem that will utilize the new alUSD. Before creating new applications for alUSD, early users can be the first to participate in Alchemix's liquidity extraction program.</p>
<h3>Where can you buy an ALCX token?</h3>
<p>Because ALCX is an altcoin, you need to find a crypto exchange with which you can trade. In this case, it is the Sushiswap and 1Inch exchanges that offer trading of the ALCX token with different currency pairs. To trade on these exchanges, you must first register there.
Once you have completed the registration, you will need to deposit one of the tradable currencies on the stock exchange, such as ETH, DAI, USDT, WETH (Wrapped Ether), which you will exchange for an ALCX token, which you can then send to your wallet.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>In this article, we will introduce a project that has great potential in the DeFi sector. It is called Alchemix. This protocol allows the creation of synthetic tokens that represent the future yield of the deposit. It allows users to get an almost instantaneous tokenized value compared to temporary stablecoin deposits. It introduces a new, powerful, and simple DeFi protocol that offers an unlimited number of applications to users and new tools for developers.</Excerpt>

<Title>XAG/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.3%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.37%</strong>
, respectively. Friday´s return was <strong>0.75%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>1</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. Indexation is currently creating higher lows compared to early 2021 levels. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210321_cycles_6b2e3e09ef.jpg" alt="Price indextaion and estimated cycles">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. <strong>XAG/USD</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment in the case of monthly MA, after falling below it. As we can see in the chart below, the 6 months (supported the market price twice a year) and annual MAs support bullish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210321_Mo_M_3b70978d34.jpg" alt="Daily price and periodical change">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the early 2020, there have been more downward trends that have not exceeded more than <strong>3</strong>
 consecutive days. Upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>2</strong>
 days in the same period. In the last days of the year, however, it reached its maximum (<strong>5</strong>
 days) of 2020. We could use the average annual ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.79%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.49%</strong>
. Approximately 90% confidence interval (return between <strong>-3%</strong>
 and <strong>3%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle. We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>4.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the second chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis points to neutral sentiment in the last week. The <strong>XAG/USD</strong>
 is currently very close to the demand zone (green rectangle), where the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 is. A psychological level of <strong>25.00</strong>
 may also be important. In addition, the shorter-term MA has also recently been very close to the spot price. It creates a kind of resistance. The divergence between price development and RSI motivated short-term bulls. However, they are currently having problems moving higher. Their sentiment may be supported by a longer-term MA, which is also in the demand zone.</p>

<Title>More than 600 bitcoins seized from hackers are being auctioned in France for the first time in history</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>BTC Auction in France</h2>
<p>Exactly 611 bitcoins seized from hackers were put up for auction which mostly took place on the Kapandji Morhange auction hall. Bitcoins were offered on the morning of March 17 for a starting price of € 23,250. According to AFP, they were mostly sold for 40 thousand euros per bitcoin, which, after adding the auction fee of 14.28 percent, roughly corresponded to the market price from around two o'clock in the afternoon of March the 17th.</p>
<p>The Auction Hall offers bitcoins in 437 lots from 0.11 to 2 bitcoins in the morning trading and 5 to 20 bitcoins in the afternoon in 41 lots. Overall 1600 people registered for the auction, which according to the organizers is significantly more than with traditional sales with not only the French but also the citizens of Belgium and Britain being involved. Participants had to submit identity documents to register. Those who were interested in more expensive lots had to pay a deposit of € 10,000. The auctioned bitcoins will then be transferred from the secure account to the cryptocurrency wallet of each of the future owners.</p>
<span class="post-quote">"We did well to take our time"</span>
<span class="quote-author">Organizer Ghislaine Kapandji to the AFP agency when commenting on the auction outcome</span>
<p>When the auction was planned in September, the price of bitcoin was around $ 10,000. Over the second March weekend in 2021 (12 - 14th), the cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of over $ 60,000. Simple math proves that the auction took place at the best possible time.</p>
<p>This is the first auction of its kind in France, but similar ones have been held around the world for years. The very first taking place in 2014 in the United States, followed by Canada, Australia, Belgium, and the United Kingdom. Kapandji Morhange admits that these auctions were the source of inspiration for their event.</p>
<p>In the past, The Czech Office for Government Representation in Property Affairs (ÚZSVM) also acquired virtual currencies seized from criminal activity. It is currently preparing its sale in a tender on its website. Currently, the office is preparing an offer for 0.42352938 bitcoin virtual currency units. Which is about € 19,000 at the current exchange rate.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>For the first time in history, France is auctioning more than 600 bitcoins. The confiscated cryptocurrency was obtained by the authorities during the fight against crime. The treasury has the unique opportunity to benefit from the increase in the price of bitcoins and earn about $ 30 million, according to the AFP agency.</Excerpt>

<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.45%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.44%</strong>
, respectively. Yesterday´s return was <strong>-0.02%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently negative (<strong>-2</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-2</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the initial declining phase of the cycle after falling from the level of <strong>0.8</strong>
. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of 2021, there have been more upward trends, where we have also recorded a medium-term maximum of <strong>6</strong>
 consecutive days. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. We could use the average ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.69%</strong>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports bullish sentiment, as the exchange rate creates higher lows and higher high. However, we can clearly see the stabilization phase (ranging from about <strong>108.50</strong>
 to <strong>109.20</strong>
) in recent weeks. The <strong>USD/JPY</strong>
 is currently also close to the demand zone (green rectangle) with a strong upper part, where the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>61.80%</strong>
 is. In addition, there is also a psychological level of <strong>108.00</strong>
. This could be an important level of support for short-term bulls. Volumes are slowing down, which could indicate an accumulation of trade energy for the next movement. The psychological level at <strong>110.00</strong>
 (the Fibonacci retracement is also close to it) could be potential resistance to the exchange rate in case of growth.</p>

<Excerpt>The current price of the USD/JPY exchange rate is 108.75 (March 23, 2021). This pair has rebounded dynamically in recent months. However, it is currently in the stabilization phase. What could be the next move? It will also depend on fundamental data in global financial market because the Japanese yen is a kind of “safe heaven” for investors. Let’s now look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>Hot News: Tesla adds Bitcoin payment option</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Bullish news for Bitcoin</h2>
<p>According to the news released by Elon Musk on his Twitter, <strong>Tesla customers can now pay for Model X, Model 3, Model S and Model Y in the biggest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.</strong>
 This option is only available for U.S. customers, however, Elon Musk also informed that the rest of the world should have this option latest by the end of this year. Moreover, he also specified, how Tesla is going to approach the Bitcoin payments, which turns out to be even more bullish news than the acceptance of BTC itself.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/files/164360686_233883265086025_1984553226080055246_o_jpg_nc_cat_100_and_ccb_1_3_and_nc_sid_730e14_and_nc_ohc_Xu_C_Nzq_Rzk_Ik_AX_f_kzs_and_nc_ht_scontent_vie1_1_c1b31c7228.xx&oh=6c443c38b932c5d9999a8a391a52cf2d&oe=607F9415" alt="Bitcoin payment option for Tesla cars">
<span class="img-caption">Tesla allows payment in Bitcoin, Source: Twitter.com</span>
<h2>Tesla plans to HODL</h2>
<p>Elon Musk noted that Tesla is not only going to accept Bitcoin as a means of payment for its products, but HODL (slang expression for "long term holding" in the cryptocurrency world) the bitcoins it will receive via payments. The company is not planning to sell its bitcoins to fiat currencies, therefore stating that the 1,5 billion dollars of initial investment that Tesla announced in February, is not final. <strong>Tesla is planning to expand its holdings of Bitcoin directly by selling its cars.</strong>
</p>
<p>Moreover, Musk explained that Tesla also runs Bitcoin nodes, essentially becoming part of the network and helping to host and synchronise the blockchain of the biggest cryptocurrency. This clearly shows that the e-car manufacturer does believe in Bitcoin, which was met with price increase of the biggest cryptocurrency of 5 % after the announcement.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Tesla allowed for Bitcoin payments only. <strong>No other cryptocurrencies are supported at the time of writing.</strong>
 Even forks of Bitcoin such as Bitcoin SV or Bitcoin Cash are not supported by the digital wallets of Tesla, meaning that only Bitcoin can be used as a payment method.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Only few weeks ago Tesla informed that it bought more that 1,5 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin. At that time, Elon Musk, the most prominent person in Tesla company said that Tesla is also planning to add a plug-in option, which would allow users to pay in the biggest cryptocurrency. As it turns out, less than 2 months after this announcement, Tesla is ready to start accepting crypto payments.</Excerpt>

<Title>Volkswagen – FOMO is here</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Volkswagen vs. Tesla</h2>
<p>Volkswagen presented an excellent investment opportunity a few months ago. It is not only because of its core business, but it also expected it to continue investing in EV technology and start focusing more in this direction. However, in this respect, it can be said that he was underestimated. For several reasons:</p>
<p>•	compared to the entire EV sector, the company was significantly undervalued, despite massive sales volume,
•	has a significantly stronger financial position than the majority of EV companies,
•	has its distribution networks and millions of loyal customers around the world,
•	market share in Europe is stable and high,
•	it was only a matter of time when "valuation matters."</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: Patrik Mackovych | Walfir</span>
<p>In recent weeks, we can see a significant increase in Volkswagen shares' price and a relatively strong price drop on Tesla shares. As I show in the chart above, Volkswagen has several times higher sales than Tesla, but its market capitalization is still significantly lower. Showing Price-to-Sales is below 1.00, and Tesla is around 20. Is this mid-term growth in Tesla shares justified?... even though the market is pricing the too high growth of Tesla in the coming years. Volkswagen has been in the market for many more years and is established, so to say that Tesla will gain dominance, especially in Europe, is very bold. Even if Tesla could once gain market share as Volkswagen, what would be its market share? 3-5 trillion for the same or similar business model, similar operating margin, similar CAPEX? If so, then Volkswagen has much room to grow…. If not, the bubble will burst.</p>

<h2>Latest news</h2>
<p>Volkswagen sold 422,000 electric and hybrid cars last year. They say their new ID.4 model is a "gamechanger." Volkswagen has invested and continues to plan to invest billions in building new production facilities. "<em>Europe is probably going to be about 70% EVs within ten years. I'd say China probably around 50%, and I think the U.S. would be closer to 30%, 40% or somewhere in there,</em>
" says Keogh (CEO), who calls the global transition to EV a massive adoption of the new technology.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/vv_spread_7292019654.PNG" alt="default">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Tradingview</span>
<p>The price has exploded tens of percent higher in recent weeks. The graph is too extended, and you have to wait for the pullback, which will most likely come. The spread between EMA 50 and 5 is reaching historical levels, indicating that this growth is too optimistic. Besides, the price is in a strong resistance band. In the short term, a decline is very likely if the situation calms down a bit and after FOMO. However, the long-term potential may not be exhausted.</p>

<Title>Fundament of the week: Token vs Coin - what are the main differences?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What is a coin?</h2>
<p>A digital coin (BTC, LTC, etc.) is an asset that originates in its own blockchain. Digital coin transactions can take place from one person to another. However, no physical coins are involved during sending and receiving. All coins exist as data in a huge global database. This database (blockchain) tracks all transactions and is checked and verified by computers around the world.</p>
<h2>How are coins used?</h2>
<p>Digital coins are generally used in the same manner as real coins. You can imagine coins like Bitcoin, Litecoin, or Monero as well as coins in your wallet. They often serve no other purpose than to be used as money. These "cash" coins are used for:</p>
<li>Money transfer (using them to give and receive value)</li>
<li>Preserving value (can be saved and exchanged later on)</li>
<li>Price unit (they can be used to evaluate goods or services)</li>
<p>To make sure you really understand the statements above, we will use Bitcoin for example. It can be used to pay for goods and services all over the internet and in many places in the real world. It can be preserved for a long time and nothing will happen to it. You can later exchange it for an item at a similar price level. The things you buy can also be priced in BTC.</p>
<h2>Examples of coins</h2>
<p>At present, all digital assets with the largest market capitalization are defined as coins. However, not all coins do have a large market capitalization. The <strong>Coinmarketcap</strong>
 pricing website contains several hundred or thousands of different examples of coins.</p>
<p>Of course, we will not list individual digital coins here. You can find their complete list on the Coinmarketcap page. For starters, we will mention some of the most famous: Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), Monero (XMR).</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/pexels_worldspectrum_844124_e95c0724f5.jpg" alt="Cryptocurrency coins Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: The most prominent cryptocurrencies of today usually have their own coin</span>
<h2>What is a token?</h2>
<p>Tokens are often called digital coins. However, this is not entirely correct. There is one fundamental difference. Tokens are created on existing blockchains. Thanks to the creation and facilitation of intelligent contracts, Ethereum is the most common blockchain token platform. The tokens that are built on the Ethereum platform are called ERC-20 tokens.</p>
<p>There are also others, such as NEO, Waves, Lisk, and Stratis. For example, NEO uses tokens known as NEP-5 tokens. Anyone can create their own token on each of these platforms.</p>
<h2>How are tokens made?</h2>
<p>In fact, it does not require a high level of technical skill. Although I would not recommend it to a complete beginner, it would not take as long as it might seem to someone with basic programming experience. However, the developer must spend some of the initial coins on the blockchain on which the token is created. For example, if a token is created on an Ethereum server, the creator will need to spend some ETH to make the miners on the network validate the token transaction.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that fees must be paid for all token transactions on the blockchain, not just for creating a token. Therefore, each application built on the Ethereum server must use ETH coins to transfer application-specific tokens from one user to another or between the application and the user. This is the same as paying fees to network operators for coin transactions.</p>
<h2>The purpose of tokens</h2>
<p>Most tokens exist to be used with decentralized applications or dApps for short. If developers create their tokens, they can decide how many units they want to create and where these new tokens are sent when they are created. At this point, they pay with part of the original cryptocurrency on the blockchain on which they want to create the token. Once created, tokens are often used to activate the features of the application for which they were designed.</p>
<p>For example, Musicoin is a token that allows users to access various features of the Musicoin platform. Such as watching a music video or streaming a song.</p>
<p>Binance (crypto exchange) also has its own token. If users trade with a BNB (Binance token), their fees are 50% lower.</p>
<p>Some tokens are created for a completely different purpose: to <strong>represent a physical object</strong>
. Let's say you wanted to sell your house through a smart contract. You cannot physically enter your house into a smart contract, but instead, you can use a token that represents your house.</p>
<p>WePower (WPR) is a good example of a token that represents a physical entity - electricity. The WePower project is a dApp that allows users to buy and sell electricity on a blockchain using smart contracts. Its token (WPR) represents a certain amount of energy.</p>
<h2>The main advantage of creating a token</h2>
<p>Because the dApp and token developers do not have to create their own blockchain, it saves them time and resources. It can thus use the cryptocurrency features of its application while taking advantage of the security of the native blockchain.</p>
<p>If the developer creates his own blockchain and coins instead of dApp and token, he will also have to find miners to verify his transactions.</p>
<p>Creating a strong blockchain requires many miners. For many computers, it makes sense to work on a single shared blockchain on which several applications can run, rather than work on thousands of weak and mostly centralized blockchains. It is a much more tedious and expensive process.</p>
<h2>Another look at how tokens work</h2>
<p>Tokens are used to interact with decentralized applications that are built on a variety of blockchains. A good example is Civic, which uses a token called CVC.</p>
<p>Their application monitors encrypted identities on the Ethereum blockchain. Its goal is to provide a cheaper, more reliable, and more effective way to verify identity. Let's see how it works in practice.</p>
<p>If you are going abroad, you have to confirm your identity in many places along the way. The first identity verification being, for example, an airline company. If the airline company you buy plane tickets from was a partner of Civic company, they would send you a QR code with information about you (the passenger). Using the Civic app, you then send your data directly to the company from your mobile device. The information is stored on the device and is fully encrypted. This prevents their theft. You can really prove that you are the owner of the received data by taking fingerprints or providing them with an eye scan.</p>
<p>Then you can use the same device to verify your identity at different points of travel (airport, hotel, etc.). Any company or organization that uses your digital identity can verify the data using a blockchain. The more the application is used, the higher is the level of trust of third parties in digital identity stored in the Civic application.</p>
<p>The CVC token itself is used for transactions in these identity-related services. It is used to pay identity verifiers (banks, governments, and other trusted sources) to issue the necessary checks to "known customers." These records are then stored in the blockchain.</p>
<p>Some CVCs are also sent to users. This should encourage the use of Civic, as companies that need to verify documents will eventually have to buy more tokens from users. This creates an environment in which everyone is rewarded for participating.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>You should now be able to understand what is meant by digital coin or digital token.</p>
<p>Let’s repeat the basic definition of both coin and token: coins originate in their own blockchain, while tokens were created on another blockchain, such as Ethereum, NEO, or Waves.</p>
<p>Coins are most often used simply as money. However, some coins have other uses. These include the use of coins to support applications, use as a deposit to verify a network transaction, or use to support intelligent transactions with contracts and tokens.</p>
<p>Tokens serve a different purpose. If they were created for use in dApp, their purpose will depend on the application itself. In some cases, they involve functions such as voting rights. In other cases, they are used for transactions in dApp (such as Civic) or to reward users for things such as discounted fees (Binance).</p>

<Title>S&P 500 (SPY) – Insiders in the lowest activity for a decade</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>It has been interesting to follow the so-called "Insider trading" throughout the market in recent years and months. It is a crucial indicator that can help us in making investment decisions. The fact that insiders buy or sell shares of their company can be ascertained with the SEC's help. Nowadays, it is no longer a problem to find this information.</p>
<h2>What to be aware of?</h2>
<p>If one or more insiders sell in small quantities, this may be of little importance to the market. This could be for several reasons: they acquired shares from options, which they then wanted to sell for their needs. They can also sell shares because of the bonuses they received in shares and tried to monetize them. However, important information comes to the market when we learn that insiders have bought or sold their shares in <strong>significant quantities.</strong>
 The example below shows how much it depends on the volumes that insiders buy or sell. MDLA, insider trading, and subsequent response.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/insider_trading_769b1fbc4d.PNG" alt="MDLA insider trading.">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Gurufocus</span>
<p>Insider trading is not a "gamechanger". Sometimes there is no reason, but there may be an indication that the company is undervalued or overvalued from its managers' point of view. Alternatively, they know information that the market does not yet know (positive or negative).</p>
<h2>Insiders are smart investors</h2>
<p>It certainly applies to <strong>insiders</strong>
 that they usually <strong>think smar</strong>
t. They buy on dips and sell on tops. This and how they buy in the US in all companies and volumes for each period is shown in the chart below. It monitors the price of the ETF SPY, which is following the S&P 500 index. Then we can see the "ratio", which gives the ratio of the number of buyers and sellers. In practice, the higher this ratio, the greater the buying interest of insiders and vice versa. We also show a 3-month moving average for better monitoring of market sentiment in the medium term.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/SPY_and_buy_Sell_ratio_3f204a37c9.png" alt="default">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Patrik Mackovych's calculation. Data by gurufocus.</span>
<p>The current ratio and the three-month average indicate very low insider's bullish activity. Take a look and compare the situations that happened if we do not see insiders' interest at such levels in the past. Our average is at its <strong>lowest</strong>
 level since 2007, which is <strong>not very good news for bulls</strong>
.</p>

<Excerpt>An insider in the financial market is a person who is associated with a particular company. Mostly it is the top management (CEO, CFO, Director ..). It can also be a person or a company with at least a 10% stake in the company.</Excerpt>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: Uniswap launches new version of V3</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Uniswap Labs has set off to improve its capabilities in the areas of liquidity supply, capital efficiency, and the quality of execution of trades. This adjustment was necessary due to the increased participation in crypto exchanges among competing projects. Hayden Adams, as the founder of Uniswap Labs, said that V3 will be a critically important protocol in the field of decentralized finance.</p>
<h2>History of Uniswap</h2>
<p>Uniswap is a relatively new project that was introduced by Hayden Adams on November 2, 2018. This project did not receive more support until 2019 when Paradigm Capital invested more than $ 1 million in the Uniswap project. Another progress came in 2020 when other companies and private investors invested about $ 11 million.
In May 2020, Uniswap introduced the V2 version, which brought with it new features and optimizations. New features included smart loans, protection from hacker attacks, and the overall improvement of the system’s robust infrastructure.
The V3 version brings better capital efficiency, easier business execution, overall better cooperation, and even cheaper fees than the V2 version.</p>
<h2>Disadvantages of Uniswap</h2>
<p>When it comes to the disadvantages of Uniswap, we must mention the possible transaction rejection due to low liquidity one might face. In most cases, this only occurs with new and small tokens, however, larger tokens should remain unaffected. Another possible issue is that the transaction may fail due to low fees for miners.
You can get to Uniswap practically with any ERC-20 token, so there are a lot of dubious and speculative tokens you should be careful about. There are many fraudulent tokens that are worthless, benefiting from the ignorance of the people who fall into the trap of buying them.</p>
<h2>Uniswap exchange</h2>
<p>Thanks to the popularity of decentralized finance and the overall support of the community, Uniswap is one of the largest and most used decentralized exchanges. Overall, Uniswap has significantly contributed to the world of DEFI, and we can expect that if the popularization of this field increases, so will the popularity of the "UNI" token and the overall usability of the Uniswap exchange. After all, only a few years ago, no one knew what the Uniswap Exchange was.

<Title>XCU/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.25%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.20%</strong>
, respectively. Friday´s return was <strong>2.35%</strong>
, which is more than the <em>1st standard deviation</em>
. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-2</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. Indexation is currently at the same levels as in the beginning of <strong>2021</strong>
. Bulls need to see the cycle change upwards. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. The <strong>XCU/USD</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment in the case of monthly MA, after falling below it in recent days. As we can see in the chart below, the 6 months and annual MAs support bullish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210328_Mo_M_c3496a20d7.jpg" alt="Daily price and periodical change">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>There were more upward trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>11</strong>
 consecutive days, after a large decline also due to <em>COVID-19</em>
. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>2</strong>
 days in the same period. The most negative trend in the last <strong>3</strong>
 years reached <strong>12</strong>
 consecutive days just before the decline of global markets in <strong>2020</strong>
. We could use the average annual ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.75%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.80%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-2.5%</strong>
 and <strong>2.5%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle. We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>3.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the second chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis shows a slightly negative sentiment for the last month. The <strong>XCU/USD</strong>
 is currently very close to the psychological level of <strong>4.00</strong>
. In addition, the shorter-term MA has also recently been very close to the spot price. The divergence between price development and RSI motivated short-term bears at the end of February. The demand zone (green rectangle), where the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>38.20%</strong>
 is also, could be a strong support in the event of a further decline.</p>

<Title>The first NFT art exhibition in New York</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>In the last few months, newspaper headlines have been dominated by NFT-related topics. That is when a number of well-known currencies such as the NBA, Grimes, and Mark Cuban entered the blockchain-backed industry. In response to this, traditional art houses such as Sotheby's and Christie's focused on NFT art.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/NFT_art1_4012551665.jpg" alt="NFT art example">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: NFT art example</span>
<p>The NFT Superchief Gallery opened on March 25 with the “Season One Starter Pack” exhibition, which will feature NFT artwork from 300 multi-genre artists. Every day until May 25, the gallery will feature NFT artworks from five different artists. This will create an ever-changing exhibition with slightly different artworks displayed each day.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/NFT_art2_6478b0e3c8.jpg" alt="Superchief NFT art group logo">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Superchief Gallery NFT logo</span>
<h2>Where exactly in New York is the NFT gallery located?</h2>
<p>The Superchief art collective, which operates galleries in New York, Miami, and Los Angeles, has announced the launch of a new gallery in Union Square. The NFT Gallery exhibition is also possible thanks to the cooperation with Blackdove, a manufacturer of high-resolution digital art screens.</p>
<h2>„Season One Starter Pack“</h2>
<p>The first exhibition, entitled "Season One Starter Pack", represents a wide network of more than 300 artists. Each of them will auction the NFT of their exhibited work. The gallery will accept payments with cryptocurrencies and credit cards.</p>
<p>The exhibition responds to the claims of various galleries and museums around the world, which have longed to display works based on the NFT for some time. All this was preceded by an exhibition based on the Crypropunks, already exhibited in 2017, or pioneers like Kevin Abosh, based on the blockchain long before.</p>
<h2>Another NFT exhibitions</h2>
<p>The Russian Hermitage Museum will host an NFT exhibition featuring works by artists such as Abosch. This Friday (March 26, 2021), the museum in Beijing also opened its first large NFT exhibition.</p>
<p>Critic, collector, and artist Kenny Schacter is also planning a double physically-virtual show, probably the first of its kind in the world, on April 9 at the German Nagel Draxler Gallery. It will take place simultaneously in the “Metaverse” and also at two virtual crypto museums: the Museum of Crypto Art (MOCA) with Colborn Bell, and the Museum of Contemporary Digital Art (MoCDA) with Serena Tabacchi and Georg Bak.</p>
<p>Many institutions have had the NFT on their radars for several months. Although until recently the NFT was considered an obscure technical curiosity, today it is not uncommon to see it being mentioned in the daily news. Likewise, large media publications, which have traditionally completely ignored blockchain topics, are now covering the NFT. This is partly due to the absurd sums of money flowing into it. For example, this month, the legendary Christie’s Auction House sold the work of digital artist Beeple for more than $ 69 million.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Currently, the NFT art attracts a new player that brings it to the otherwise traditional environment - an art gallery. The Superchief art group that already has branches in Los Angeles, New York, and Miami, is launching its new NFT gallery in New York.</Excerpt>

<Title>PayPal allows its users to pay in cryptocurrencies all over the world</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>PayPal allows its users to pay with crypto</h2>
<p>The news were first released today in the morning by Reuters, but have already been confirmed by <a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1376898069925597185">PayPal</a>
 itself. The gigantic payment platform decided to allow for cryptocurrency payments for its US users for all 29 million merchant stores all around the world. Users from other countries should have this option later this year. According to many, this can potentially mark the beginning of mass adoption of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. This view is for example represented by CEO of PayPal Dan Schulman.</p>
<span class="post-quote">"This is the first time you can seamlessly use cryptocurrencies in the same way as a credit card or a debit card inside you PayPal wallet. We think it is a transitional point where cryptocurrencies move from being predominantly an asset class that you buy, hold and or sell to now becoming a legitimate funding source to make transactions in the real world at millions of merchants.”</span>
<span class="quote-author">Dan Schulman, CEO of PayPal</span>
<p>According to the news, PayPal will not charge any transaction fees on the cryptocurrency payments. Moreover, it specified that the purchases can now be done with 4 cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash). There is not a possibility of paying one bill or transaction with two different cryptocurrencies at the same time, which however is very logical and easily understandable step.</p>
<p>PayPal also specified that it will always transfer the money to the merchants in fiat, meaning that even after the cryptocurrency transaction is done, PayPal will convert the cryptocurrencies at given rate to fiat currencies, which will be then send to the merchants. This should protect them from the volatility that is now closely related to the cryptocurrency world. This is also a different approach than Tesla, for instance, since the e-car company plans to keep the bitcoins it gets as a means of payments, whereas PayPal will always convert the cryptocurrencies to the fiat.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Only 7 days ago we mentioned huge news regarding cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. One of the biggest companies in the world right now, Tesla, has allowed payments in Bitcoin, which is in the sector believed to be one of the most important news of the year so far.  It might be possible though that PayPal came with something even bigger.</Excerpt>

<Title>USD/CHF statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.46%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.48%</strong>
, respectively. Yesterday´s return was only <strong>0.05%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the last ascending phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>There have been more downward trends since the <strong>COVID-19</strong>
 outbreak when we also recorded a medium-term maximum of <strong>9</strong>
 consecutive days. Upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>5</strong>
 days in the same period. The maximum range from the beginning of 2021 is <strong>4</strong>
 days in both directions. We could use the average ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.74%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.42%</strong>
. Approximately 90% confidence interval (return between <strong>-1%</strong>
 and <strong>1%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>Basic technical analysis still supports bullish sentiment, as the exchange rate creates higher lows and higher high. However, we can clearly see the divergence between the market price and the RSI. The <strong>USD/CHF</strong>
 is currently also close to the supply zone (red rectangle) with a strong lower part, where the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>61.80%</strong>
 is. In addition, there is also a psychological level of <strong>0.9500</strong>
. This could be an important level of resistance for short-term bulls. A psychological level of <strong>0.9300</strong>
 could be another potential support for the exchange rate in the event of a decline.</p>

<Title>Bonds - Great Opportunity or bubble is bursting?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of 2021, the <strong>ECB indirectly indicated</strong>
 that it closely monitored <strong>the growth of bond yields and subsequently decided to intervene in a similar way to purchase longer-term bonds to reduce the yield curve</strong>
 and corporate investment and interest in lending to continue. We can see the opposite situation in the USA, where cheap money and fiscal stimuli are also flowing, but here we can see a split in the US central bank's monetary policy. <strong>Fed</strong>
 said that at the current level of government bond yields, <strong>they are not worried</strong>
, which indicated that they are <strong>not currently planning to buy larger bonds with higher maturities. We assume that if US government bond yields hit levels of about 1.8 percent or more, then the US Federal Reserve would follow a similar path.</strong>
</p>
<h2>Opportunity to buy or threaten a bigger slump?</h2>
<p>In the next chart, we can see the different price development of <strong>ETFs between US government bonds with a maturity of 20 years and euro area government bonds with a maturity of 25 years</strong>
 or more. In recent weeks, however, we can see a slump in both assets. However, volatility varies, and so does the level of decline—some talk about "cleaning the market" and bursting the bond bubble. However, we still consider it a correction. However, it is interesting to monitor the long-term trend of individual ETFs and their volatility. While the ETF for euro area government bonds has been improving in the long run, we can confirm this by the slump. ETFs in the euro area have fallen by around 10-11% since their peak, while ETFs in the US with slightly lower maturities have fallen by almost 22% since their peak. <strong>These corrections can be a perfect opportunity.</strong>
</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: Tradingview</span>
<h2>Seasonality or what does history tell us?</h2>
<p>Although bonds are not subject to a certain seasonality, which can cause extreme shocks in demand and supply, we still put historically strong months into context. According to Guggenheim Investments, the best months for 10-year bonds are ahead of us. These are the months: April, May, June, July, and August, where historically, according to the median, yields fall the most (yield falls -> the price of a bond rises). According to the data below, the month is very strong in June, and yields tend to decrease statistically. Both the interquartile range and the median speak of it. Nowhere is it written that history will repeat itself, but this is a statistic.</p>

]]></Content>
<Excerpt>In recent months, bonds, mostly outside the EU, have experienced a relatively steep drop. We are talking about bonds with long-term maturities of ten, twenty years, and more. Longer-dated bonds may be relatively more volatile but may have interesting yield potential. In recent months, we have seen a slight decline in longer-term maturities.</Excerpt>

<Title>Bitcoin Sunday: Technical Analysis of Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>Let us start again on the daily chart, where absolutely nothing has changed lately. The chart is still going sideways. The question remains what happens next. At this point, the BTC is still in the bull run, and week after week news comes only to confirm continuing growth of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Tesla, Visa, Mastercard. All of these corporations are related to mentioned recent news about Bitcoin, which should send the price of this cryptocurrency up. But why there is no growth as of now? The answer is consolidation. We cannot make short-term decisions based on fundamentals. The fundaments only show us that in the long run, the price could still rise, but in the short term, it will tell us absolutely nothing. Indeed, news such as the adoption of BTC by Tesla or the VISA partnership failed to push the price up. That means only one thing - the price is not yet ready to go up.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: BTC price analysis on a daily chart</span>
<h2>4H chart</h2>
<p>As for this chart, I see a decline to $ 54,000 -  $ 55,000 as the closest move. I understand this side movement as a mere "respite" before further growth. As you can see in this chart, we broke through the channel which is really important. Because as long as we were in the channel, we were more in the correction structure. It was not until the channel broke that got us back in the game.</p>
<p>Before the new high, however, we have another strong resistance at $ 58,200 - $ 59,388. If we can cross this line, then nothing prevents Bitcoin from further growth to a new maximum. From the point of view of the whole structure, our support is absolutely crucial. Bitcoin should not fall back into the channel at this point. It should maintain support and the trend line. If you should remember one thing from today’s analysis, let it be this one.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: BTC price analysis on a 4H chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am going to repeat my words from last week. Bitcoin is still bullish and at this point, there is nothing that should suggest any change happening any time soon.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Technical Analysis of Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>Not much is happening on the daily chart. The situation is more or less the same. The last month could be described in one word - consolidation. The price went up and down during the month, but as a result, it did not move anywhere in particular. However, I still see this structure as prone to growth for several reasons. The first reason is the fact that we keep on following the trend line. The second reason is the constant sticking to the chart in the bull market, while the indicators are falling, the chart continues going to the side.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_fri_1_1623a5aa4f.png" alt="Bitcoin technical analysis daily chart">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Bitcoin on a daily chart</span>
<h2>4H chart</h2>
<p>Here the situation is a little more interesting. Looking at the chart, we notice several key features. We consolidate below the maximum. The history of past bull-runs, as well as this one, showed us that whenever we moved sideways in a similar way below the absolute maximum, it was only a preparation for further growth. However, it is important to realize that the graph cannot grow continuously. Before each significant growth, enough buy orders must be collected which takes some time. I would compare the whole situation to stress. The more stress you build up without venting it naturally, the more explosive will be your overall reaction once the stress exceeds a tolerable level. If, on the other hand, there is little stress, no “explosions” occur.</p>
<p><strong>As for the 4H chart in the coming days, I see only two possible scenarios. Both of which end up at a new maximum.</strong>
</p>
<li>The first scenario predicts testing values of $ 54,600 - $ 55,400, followed by a rebound from support, ending with an attack to a new high.</li>
<li>The second option revolves around price continuing to the side, probably in the formation of a triangle. An upward movement will follow.</li>
<p>In both cases, these are bullish movements. In order for the bearish scenario to occur, the price would have to break down through the mentioned support.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Bitcoin on a daily chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is still continuing in a bullish trend with no signs of change whatsoever. The longer we will consolidate under the peak price, the more explosive growth I expect.</p>

<Title>DISCOVERY – Another anomaly in the market</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Walt Disney owns some of the most globally recognized characters, from Mickey Mouse to Luke Skywalker. These characters and others are featured in several Disney theme parks around the world. Disney makes live-action and animated films under studios such as Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm and operates media networks including ESPN and several TV production studios.</p>
<h2>What happened?</h2>
<p>Little has happened at Viacom and Discovery's events. Shares, which have seen an alarming growth in recent days, have now slid and are in solid sell-offs. This was due to the liquidation of positions. Bloomberg News reported that Archegos Capital Management was forced by banks to sell more than $20 billion worth of shares after some positions were moved against it. Meaning, Swiss banking giant Credit Suisse (CS) has warned that volatility stems from the firm's liquidation will force the bank to hit first-quarter results "highly significantly."</p>
<p>I recall that, along with ViacomCBS and many Chinese technology stocks, Discovery Class A was one of the shares that saw a block deal related to the forced liquidation of positions associated with Bill Hwang Archegos' hedge fund. However, while many expected the revival to push Class A shares sharply higher now that the release appears to have ended, <strong>Class B stocks where the trading frenzy took place on Wednesday, with 684,000 shares on Wednesday, more than the 20,000% three-month average.</strong>
</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/discovery_spread_b4bd2086ce.png" alt="Spread between DIS stonk Class A and Class B">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Tradingview</span>
<p>According to Bloomberg, Bright Trading prop trader Dennis Dick said what is happening may be an extreme example of what an "arb squeeze" where instead of buying Class A shares, funds who were forced to buy-in due to a short squeeze or some other reason, have moved to the Class B shares instead:</p>
<p>"<em>It could be that arbitrage traders went in and maybe found that it was tough to borrow on one share class, so they went into the one that is more thinly traded. Just because the share classes are fundamentally linked, that doesn't necessarily mean they will trade alike</em>
".</p>
<p>We can see an exemplary example of an anomaly in the market that is not a shortage in 2021. It should be mentioned that although Class A and Class B shares may not trade equally, in the medium term, the price is fundamentally tied. It means that if there is a <strong>discrepancy</strong>
 between them, <strong>it is a short-term opportunity to correct this "side effect."</strong>
 This phenomenon can be seen in the following graph, which shows the spread between Class A and Class B.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/spread_d_5008e4942e.PNG" alt="Spread between Class A and Class B">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Tradingview</span>
<p>This gap has widened in recent weeks. However, Class A is much more liquid, so investors are looking for this form logically. However, Class B completely broke away from reality, which is also indicated by a significant spread at the end of March and April. We have given the reasons for the increase above. <strong>We assume that such a considerable spread will not last long, maybe 1-3 weeks, until the spread decreases significantly.</strong>
 Different strategies can be applied through CFDs (long of one asset and short of another), and the target should not be set by the price but by the spread's average over the last 10-15 days (somewhere at $ 20). Different strategies can also be applied through option contracts.</p>

<Title>XAU/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.77%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.77%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.40%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.36%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>-0.08%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>2</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>1</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. Indexation is currently in a growing phase of the cycle. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210403_cycles_f2b0efbd3f.jpg" alt="Estimated cycles of gold">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. The <strong>XAU/USD</strong>
 is in bullish sentiment in the case of monthly MA, after rising above it in recent days. As we can see in the chart below, the 6 months and annual MAs still support bearish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210403_Mo_M_60e27a9fa9.jpg" alt="Daily price development of gold">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Recently, there have been more downward trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>5</strong>
 consecutive days. More negative days for this commodity last appeared at the end of <strong>2018</strong>
. Upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>1</strong>
 day in the same period. In the first days of this year, however, we witnessed <strong>5</strong>
 positive days. We could use the average annual ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.59%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.85%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.6%</strong>
 and <strong>1.6%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>2.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210403_lh_4be4eec447.jpg" alt="Daily low to high distribution of gold ">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to neutral sentiment for the last month after the sideways development of the price. The <strong>XAU/USD</strong>
 is currently in the demand zone (green rectangle), where the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>61.80%</strong>
 is also, along with the psychological level of <strong>1 700</strong>
. In addition, the spot price has created a double bottom pattern that could motivate bulls. The divergence between price development and the RSI created in the last <strong>4</strong>
 months could support this scenario. If the price breaks above <strong>1 760</strong>
, where the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50%</strong>
 is also, we could see its increase to the resistance line of <strong>1 850</strong>
.</p>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: PancakeSwap (CAKE) cuts part of Uniswap's dominance in DeFi</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>In the last month, decentralized finance has been battling with issues revolving around non-functional tokens. However, this did not prevent the best DeFi projects from developing. As a result, strategies have been improved and their ecosystems developed which consequently led to increased market share.</p>
<p>One of the projects is the mentioned PancakeSwap (CAKE). An automated market maker based on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) that allows users to exchange tokens and profit from yield farming fees.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/pancake2_88b8a3935a.png" alt="Monthly trading volume on PancakeSwap">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Monthly trading volume on PancakeSwap. (Source: Delphi Digital)</span>
<p>According to a recent report by Delphi Digital, several factors have played a significant role in the development of the PancakeSwap ecosystem. In the future, analysts predict that it will continue to be a competitor of Uniswap.</p>
<h2>Higher fees on Ethereum network</h2>
<p>Anyone trying to make a transaction on the ETH network in recent months must have noticed a large increase in fees as well as the rising price of Ethereum.</p>
<p>While fees on the Ethereum network increased, Binance Smart Chain proved to be a good choice, thanks to its low transaction fees. PancakeSwap also benefits from a large influx of users and Binance’s larger user base.</p>
<p>Its <em>"vast network effect comes from being the biggest crypto exchange that is typically the first choice for retail traders."</em>
 According to analysts at Delphi Digital.</p>
<h2>Inflation as a problem?</h2>
<p>Delphi Digital has highlighted the PancakeSwap token economy, which is important for its future growth.</p>
<p>Unlike UNI and SUSHI, there is no limit on the delivery of CAKE tokens. The current weekly inflation rate of CAKE is <strong>3.78%</strong>
, and that is well above the annual inflation rate of UNI, which is <strong>2%</strong>
.</p>
<p>Despite various deflation measures. The current net emission is approximately <strong>1,000,000 CAKE per week</strong>
 – which translates to <strong>37%</strong>
 real inflation annually (or <strong>0.7%</strong>
 weekly).</p>
<p>According to Delphi Digital, PancakeSwap is aware of what today's inflation figures look like. The team has already announced a vote to change emissions. They either remain the same or reduce them to <strong>23.5</strong>
 or <strong>22</strong>
 CAKE per block.</p>
<p>If emissions were reduced to 22 CAKE, it would represent a reduction of <strong>20%</strong>
. At present, this would lead to emissions reduction by <strong>1,050,000 CAKE</strong>
 which would be a small victory. Consequently, it would also help to neutralize inflation and maintain its place in the market in the long run.</p>
<p>Strong support from Binance and low fees on the Binance Smart Chain put PancakeSwap in an advantageous position. At this point, it tries to attract additional liquidity from ethereum-based DeFi protocols which currently suffer from astronomical transaction fees.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Thanks to its integration into the Binance Smart Chain, PancakeSwap has become a magnet of liquidity compared to competitors such as Uniswap and SushiSwap.</Excerpt>

<Title>BlackRock and Bitcoin? </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Interest from BlackRock’s side</h2>
<p>In January this year, BlackRock already announced the interest of their users in Bitcoin.
The company subsequently filed an application with the SEC (US Securities and Exchange Commission). The corporation announced that it held $ 360,000 worth of futures contracts. The expiration of these contracts was due March 26, 2021, on the Chicago Stock Exchange. The total percentage of these assets was only 0.0014% of the entire fund.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: BlackRock headquarters in New York</span>
<h2>BlackRock's clients demand Bitcoin</h2>
<p>The company has seen enormous demand for investing in the Bitcoin cryptocurrency from its clients. <strong>BlackRock's chief investment officer, Rick Rieder, said that in the foreseeable future, Bitcoin may exceed the market capitalization of gold</strong>
. And it is exactly this idea that a large number of their investors is playing with. It is mostly thanks to the fact that Bitcoin seems to be an excellent guarantee as a hedge against inflation, and one of the ways to preserve the value of the money earned.</p>
<h2>A vision of Larry Fink the CEO of BlackRock</h2>
<p>In a 2018 interview with Bloomberg, Larry Fink said that they had absolutely no client who would demand or be indirectly interested in investing in Bitcoin. And that was why BlackRock decided not to deal with Bitcoin and focus on other possible assets instead. Currently, after 3 years, Larry Fink has announced that Bitcoin can become a global market in the future. And Rick Rieder (CIO) from Blackrock has argued that Bitcoin will, to some extent, take the position of gold as the main store of value.</p>
<h2>BlackRock - Investment management company</h2>
<p>The New York-based company was founded in 1988. It is currently the largest financial asset manager in the world. It has more than 16,200 employees and offices in more than 30 countries with clients all over the world. The company was created by a genius of Robert Steven Kapito and co-founder Laurence Douglas Fink. And it currently manages $ 8.68 trillion in assets.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Bitcoin - The money of the future
</span>
<h2>Will BlackRock's interest shape how Bitcoin is perceived in the world of finance?</h2>
<p>The very fact that large companies and funds such as BlackRock, VISA, Mastercard, MicroStrategy, Tesla have started offering the option of payment or direct investment in Bitcoin is excellent news for fans of this cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>It can be perceived as the gradual integration of Bitcoin in the world. It also puts Bitcoin in the center of attention and helps it to gain the credibility of the public. Among other things, the involvement of these big companies in the world of Bitcoin also forces all other, albeit smaller, companies to consider the Bitcoin payment method as a viable possibility. And that is something that many company analysts are losing their sleep over because if some companies offer investment or payment with Bitcoin, then other companies are "forced" to come up with this method too, or at least think about it because their customers demand it.</p>
<p>ETF applications are emerging and many of them have been already approved. Wall Street itself has, in a way, accepted Bitcoin (thanks to Morgan Stanley, which offers the opportunity to invest in a Bitcoin-related fund), and some states are interested in Bitcoin and blockchain technology.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If the global implementation of Bitcoin continues, we can really expect that one day Bitcoin's market capitalization will be larger than that of gold. This is supported by the fact that Bitcoin is currently the best investment and store of value over the last few years. And so its popularity, use, and credibility are growing day by day.</p>

<Title>DAX - Extremes bring the opportunity</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>This step was again the driving force for the stock markets. However, from a statistical point of view, the German stock index reaches short-term extremes. Despite the strong bullish momentum and fundamentals that the purchase of bonds by the ECB will continue and fiscal stimulus in Germany will continue, we need to be concerned about statistics.</p>
<p><strong>DAX reaches extremes on the weekly chart and also on the daily chart</strong>
. This is partly due to the actions of Volkswagen, which we wrote about in the previous article. However, the stock index counts for strong "recovery."</p>
<h2>Weekly extremes</h2>
<p>In this chart, we can see the number of consecutive weekly candles. <strong>We currently have 6 of them on the DAX chart. The index has been rising for six straight weeks, without one week of correction. Since 2014, Dax has maintained a strong bullish trend without a red candle only three times.</strong>
 No one says that even this time, DAX cannot grow for 8-10 weeks consecutively, but in terms of probability, this phenomenon is little likely. Momentum is still strong, but it is expected that next week, maybe this one will turn downwards. Don't imagine a drop of 7-10% or more, but rather a minor correction, which is entirely normal in a healthy bullish trend.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/dax_weekly_7e50be735d.PNG" alt="DAX weekly extremes">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Tradingview</span>
<h2>Daily extremes</h2>
<p>A similar phenomenon occurs on the daily chart. The signal is even stronger in the short term because we have a cogency on the weekly and daily charts, which increases our success in short positions in the short term. I say in advance that this is only an opinion in terms of probability and not investment advice.</p>
<p><strong>The DAX's daily chart grows for seven consecutive days, which is almost the most from the observed period. It is significantly higher than the average or median.</strong>
 Usually, the trend tends to reverse after 6-8 days. Again, don't expect a significant drop, but rather a consolidation to the side or a minor correction. From a trend perspective, it's healthy.</p>

<Title>USD/CAD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.41%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.41%</strong>
, respectively. Yesterday´s return was only <strong>0.33%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently negative (<strong>-1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in a slightly negative phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210407_Cycles_08cce54c22.jpg" alt="USD/CAD price indexation and cycles estimation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to the monthly MA, <strong>USD/CAD</strong>
 is in bullish sentiment, after rising above it. As we can see in the chart below, the 6 months and annual MAs are still in bearish sentiment. In the case of growth, a 6-month MA can be an important resistance for the exchange rate.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>There have been more downward trends since the <strong>COVID-19</strong>
 outbreak. At the beginning of this year, however, a medium-term maximum of <strong>5</strong>
 consecutive days was reached. Upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. The maximum in the measured period is <strong>7</strong>
 days. We could use the average ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.80%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.58%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-0.9%</strong>
 and <strong>0.9%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.40%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports bearish sentiment, as the exchange rate creates lower highs and lower lows. Short-term MA could be the first resistance for this pair. However, we can clearly see the divergence between the market price and the RSI. The <strong>USD/CAD</strong>
 is currently also close to the supply zone (red rectangle) with a strong upper part, where the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 is. In addition, a psychological level of <strong>1.3000</strong>
 is above this zone, along with a longer-term MA. This could be an important level of resistance for bulls.</p>

<Excerpt>The current price of the USD/CAD exchange rate is 1.2621 (April 07, 2021). This pair has slightly corrected its longer-term declining trend in recent months. The Canadian Dollar is a commodity currency and the rising price of oil may be one of the main reasons for the long downward trend. Let’s look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>Fundament of the week - Smart contracts</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Smart contracts usually provide a user interface and often emulate the logic of contractual agreements. Proponents of smart contracts argue that due to this feature, a large part of contractual agreements can be partially or completely self-executing, self-enforcing, or both. Smart contracts have the potential to provide greater security and enforcement at lower costs than traditional law. For example, they allow you to perform trusted transactions without third parties. These transactions are traceable and irreversible. So much for an introduction, let's take a closer look now.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/pexels_pixabay_357514_cabc1d9726.jpg" alt="paper contracts as the thing of the past?">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Smart contracts have the potential to render the old-fashioned paper contracts obsolete (source: pexel.com)</span>
<h2>Origin and definition</h2>
<p>Smart contracts were described by Nick Szabo in the 1990s. Even then, they were defined as a tool that formalizes and protects computer networks by attaching a network protocol to the user interface. In his groundbreaking paper, Szabo discussed potential applications for smart contracts in various areas - including credit systems, payment processes, and software that helps with managing copyrights. With the invention of Bitcoin in 2009, smart contracts moved a step closer to their real use. However, the real milestone for their use did not come until 2013, when Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood introduced the concept of the cryptocurrency Ethereum, which includes the possibility of creating smart contracts in its blockchain. Today, there are many projects that aim to extend smart contracts to the public (eg IBM Hyperledger Fabric, Share & Charge, or Propy).</p>
<p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, a smart contract can be defined, in the simplest of ways, as an application or program running on a blockchain network. Smart contracts are nothing more than digital contracts, which are enforced by a special set of rules without human intervention. These rules are predefined by computer code that is replicated and executed by all nodes operating in the network. Smart contracts created in blockchain networks allow the creation of specific network protocols in which users do not have to trust each other. This means that two parties can commit to themselves through a blockchain without being acquainted or even trusting each other when fulfilling the contractual conditions. After the contract comes into force, each of the parties can be sure that once the terms have been breached by any of them, the terms and conditions will not be met. Smart contracts also eliminate the need to seek help from third parties (intermediaries), which significantly reduces the cost of contracts concluded in this way.</p>
<h2>How smart contract works?</h2>
<p>In short, a smart contract is a deterministic program. This means that it performs a specific task as soon as the declared conditions therein are met. Smart contracts are basically a set of "if A then B" rules. Despite their name, smart contracts are not smart or legally classified contracts. Each smart contract is really just a piece of code that works thanks to a distributed network of nodes (blockchain).</p>
<p>In the Ethereum smart network, contracts are responsible for performing and managing specific blockchain operations that occur when users (real addresses) enter into specific interactions with each other. Any address that is not a smart contract is called an externally managed account (EOA). Simply put - smart contracts are sorted by computer code and EOAs are controlled by the user. Each of the smart orders in the Ethereum network basically consists of a contract code and two public keys. The first public key is the one provided by the contract creator. The second key represents the contract itself, which serves as its digital identifier. It is also is unique to any smart contract.</p>
<p>The implementation of any contract requires a transaction in the blockchain network. In addition, any smart contract must be opened by the EOA. Regardless of the source that activates the operation of the contract, the first interaction always comes from the EOA (user).</p>
<h2>Main features</h2>
<p>Smart contracts created in the Ethereum network are most often characterized by the following features:</p>
<li>They are </li>
<strong>scattered</strong>
<li>. Smart contracts are replicated and distributed to all nodes present in the Ethereum network. The way in which smart contracts are distributed and then concluded is their biggest plus compared to traditional centralized solutions (for example, servers maintaining contract provisions).</li>
<li>They are </li>
<strong>deterministic</strong>
<li>. Smart contracts only perform the activities for which they were designed. Provided that the conditions contained therein are met. The results of the performance of the contract will always be the same regardless of who initiates the first interaction.</li>
<li>They are </li>
<strong>autonomous</strong>
<li>. Smart contracts are great for automating all kinds of tasks - they work as a self-sufficient program. But what is important: in most cases, if the smart contract does not come into force, it is in "sleep mode" and does not take any action.</li>
<li>They are </li>
<strong>immutable</strong>
<li>. The code for each smart supply contract cannot be changed once it has entered into force. They can only be deleted provided such a function had previously been implemented in them. Thus, it can be said that the records in smart contracts are resistant to change.</li>
<h2>What obstacles remain to be overcome?</h2>
<p>It is a new and relatively complicated technology that, unlike traditional contracts, requires technical know-how from individual parties as well as a certain level of legal knowledge. Another obstacle is the not very user-friendly interface. In addition, their development is still in its infancy and is thus associated with high financial costs. Wider implementation is also prevented by current legislation and the legal system. And we must not forget the fact that smart contracts are only as good as the programmer who creates them. According to Hosho, which focuses on security in the crypto-industry, up to 25% of smart contracts have a critical error in the code. Nevertheless, smart contracts have great potential to positively affect many industries. They can find their application in banking, insurance, or delivery services. It is difficult to say whether this will actually happen in the coming years. However, the possibilities offered by smart contracts are revolutionary and it would be most unfortunate if they did not get a chance.</p>

<Excerpt>The term “smart contract” refers to a protocol or software that secures, verifies, or enforces the negotiation or transfer of a contract (or agreement). This can be done in a way that eliminates the need for a real physical contract between people. It goes without saying that the possibilities offered by smart contracts are revolutionary.</Excerpt>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Technical Analysis of Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>4H chart</h2>
<p>On the 4H chart, we are currently witnessing an interesting situation. Bitcoin has already broken through the big channel that it has been in for a few days. However, who was expecting a joy ride is probably disappointed at the moment. Instead, another smaller channel was created. At present, I see 3 main "obstacles" in the chart:</p>
<li>MA21</li>
<li>MA77</li>
<li>Dashed trend</li>
<p>If Bitcoin is to move further, we need it to overcome the 3 points mentioned above. We are currently fighting on the trend line. What I find concerning is the intersection of MA21 and MA77.  Albeit this is not very positive but the chart seems to have managed to overcome this intersection so far.</p>
<p>What is important to mention here is the response of altcoins in relation to Bitcoin movements happening this week. It seems that with every slight growth in Bitcoin’s price, altcoins move upward as well. However, this applies also in the opposite direction resulting in altcoin’s price decrease of 10 to 15% reacting to Bitcoin going down by 3%. The sensitivity is currently very high, so it is crucial to correctly estimate the direction of Bitcoin first.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Technical analysis of Bitcoin on 4H chart</span>
<h2>1H chart</h2>
<p>If we focus on the hourly chart, we will notice that soon enough we can expect a break of one of the trendlines. Lately, the hourly chart presents data in such a way that it seems that Bitcoin is going up to the moment of breaking the trend line. Once the line is broken, then it begins to fall to a new low. Even now, after the last correction, Bitcoin has grown quite sharply, re-establishing the trend line. However, if a downward breakdown occurs, a new low scenario may occur again. Because the trend lines hold us from below and from above, some of these lines will not last in the coming hours. And it is precisely this situation that I will personally wait for in the coming hours to be able to determine the next direction of the market.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Technical analysis of Bitcoin on 1H chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Despite all the recent price movements, Bitcoin is still bullish. The growth we have seen over the last few months is taking its toll and Bitcoin is moving more to the side. In any case, once the side movement will end, we should be witnessing the price go up once again.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Today, like any other Friday, we will look at the technical analysis of Bitcoin on the 4H and 1H charts. This time, we will omit the daily chart as nothing significant happened there.</Excerpt>

<Title>Crude Oil (WTI) statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.77%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.96%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.92%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.94%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>-0.47%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>2</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. Indexation is currently in the initial growth phase of the cycle. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. The <strong>WTI</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment in the case of monthly MA, after falling below it last month. As we can see in the chart below, the 6 months and annual MAs still support bullish sentiment.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>In the last month, we have witnessed more declining trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>4</strong>
 consecutive days. Upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>7</strong>
 days in the same period. However, the rise in prices was expected after last year’s crash. We could use the average annual ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>6.08%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>1.65%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.6%</strong>
 and <strong>3.6%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>6.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to a slightly positive sentiment with a sideways price development in recent weeks. The <strong>WTI</strong>
 is currently very close to the short-term moving average and psychological level of <strong>60.00</strong>
. This could be strong support for bulls. However, if the price continues to fall, the next stop could be the demand zone (green rectangle), where the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 is also, along with a psychological level of <strong>50.00</strong>
. Until then, there could be a long-term moving average. In addition, the divergence between price development and the RSI created in the last <strong>2</strong>
 months could support this scenario. This would represent a very similar percentage decrease as last autumn.</p>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: KickPad launches its first IDO</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Behind the curtain</h2>
<p>P2P (peer-to-peer) aspect is one of the key reasons why this cryptocurrency attracts people. Cryptocurrency assets allow users to operate in different financial markets and operate with different types of assets without intermediaries. In numbers, this trend represents $ 42 billion tied to decentralized financial projects.</p>
<p>DeFi deflation tokens obtained from high-yield farms disrupt and transform the traditional financial system. They focus on the revenue sector and emphasize community governance, which gives power to token holders. This is possible thanks to anonymous projects led by unofficial developers and published on anonymous platforms.</p>
<p>Privacy and the right to anonymity are among the core values of IDO (Initial DEX Offering) and the principle shared by the DeFi community as a whole. This is made possible by innovative actors that form the backbone of the Web 3.0 infrastructure, such as Orakuru.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/orakurupartners_270ae4bca2.jpg" alt="Orakuru partners">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1 - Orakuru partnership list</span>
<h2>What is Orakuru?</h2>
<p>Orakuru is a community-certified Binance Smart Chain. It is a credible price source and off-chain data that "bring everything" to the prediction market from job demands to the results of the UFC fights.</p>
<p>Orakuru relies on delegated nodes and a betting system. In this way, each node can be rewarded or penalized if it fails to properly verify the results. Initially, they will have seven nodes that will provide trusted services, allowing them to decentralize adequately. Each node is set up with "scrapers," which is code that retrieves data.</p>
<p>It offers the opportunity to join the official Telegram group and get the latest news, development information, and details about the launch of Orakuru. If you are good at marketing, design, or development, they have a Discord channel with the possibility of direct conversation with the team and its developers.</p>
<p>For the time being, Orakuru is mainly focused on development. In the coming weeks, it will focus on building its community. Focusing on the community is not just a marketing move, Orakuru will eventually be managed by the community. Members can contribute to development, marketing, design, participate in upcoming updates, or in administration.</p>
<p>In an article on the launch of Orakuru's IDO, they outlined a "special event" for KickPad holders.</p>
<h2>What is KickPad?</h2>
<p>Orakuru is the first KickPad project to become the pinnacle of pre-sales platforms. Transparency, security, and quality are synonymous with this IDO marketplace, as it offers an automatic liquidity lock solution. Previously, investors had to fully trust the owners of newly created projects without any safety net.</p>
<p>KickPad works on BSC and offers the benefits of fast transactions and low fees. It deals with anonymity, liquidity blocking, and refunds if the IDO does not reach its limit. Investors see how long liquidity is locked, they can monitor the progress of the trade and generate interest.</p>
<p>Part of the KickPad is also KickDex, which provides complete transparency for both the seller and the buyer. It is a resilient pre-sale platform that alleviates the stress of blocking liquidity.</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>During the pre-sale, KickDex reduces the seller's chance to run away with the money without adding and blocking liquidity on the exchange. Smart contracts force this process automatically.</p>

<Excerpt>KickPad, one of DeFi's most anticipated platforms, announces its first initial DEX (Decentralized Exchange) offering with the Orakuru project, running on the Binance Smart Chain. Once it starts, it will have the highest number of resources on the BSC.</Excerpt>

<Title>Ledger is facing a large class-action lawsuit over a massive data leak</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Ledger in court over data leak</h2>
<p>According to legal documents published on the Scribd server, the law firm Roche Freedman filed a formal complaint with Ledger and Shopify on 6 April on behalf of the two main plaintiffs. Ledger suffered a number of data breaches in 2020, and one was linked to the Shopify e-commerce platform, which hosts the company's stores and products. Ledger admitted responsibility for the Shopify incident in December 2020, in which a former employee revealed the personal information of 20,000 customers. This disruption was followed by another one that happened in the summer of the same year. Resulting in data leaks of about 292,000 Ledger customers.</p>
<span class="post-quote">“Plaintiffs seek redress for the substantial, Class-wide damages that Ledger’s and Shopify’s misconduct caused in connection with a massive 2020 data breach that those companies negligently allowed, recklessly ignored, and then intentionally sought to cover up.”
</span>
<span class="quote-author">The beginning of class action lawsuit on behalf of prosecutors John Chu and Edward Baton</span>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/ledger_e33713cf0a.jpg" alt="Lerdger faces class-action lawsuit over a data breach">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1 - Hardware cryptocurrency wallet manufactured by the Ledger company</span>
<p>The company made an unfortunate comment by claiming that the devices are still 100% safe, while their customers were saying quite the opposite. Ledger's chief lawyer, Antoine Thibault, simply said, <em>"Ledger will not comment on ongoing legal matters."</em>
</p>
<p>In an interview with The Block, law firm partner Kyle Roche said:</p>
<p><em>"We have been investigating this since the day everything went public. This investigation included interviews with data security and cryptocurrency experts."</em>
</p>
<p>The class action does not state the amount of compensation claimed. The documents refer to only two Ledger users who together lost 4.2 BTC, 11 ETH, and 150,000 XLM due to phishing attacks.</p>
<p>There will probably be thousands more.</p>
<h2>Ledger: No reimbursement</h2>
<p>Following the massive data breach, Ledger's customers chose to share their experiences on social media to vent their anger at a company that offered no compensation and largely blamed users for their negligent security.</p>
<p>Ledger customers reported everything from direct theft of cryptocurrency from Ledger’s hardware wallets to threats of physical violence, domestic invasion, or even murder.</p>
<p>Hackers and fraudsters continued to spread spam and phishing, armed with Ledger's customer databases full of personal information, which included email addresses, phone numbers, and physical addresses.</p>

<Title>AUD/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.55%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.58%,</strong>
 respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.28%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.27%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was only <strong>0.04%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>1</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in a slightly positive phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

 moving average. According to the monthly MA, <strong>AUD/USD</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment, after falling below it. As we can see in the chart below, the 6 months and annual MAs are still in bullish sentiment. In the event of a decline, the 6-month MA can be an important support for the exchange rate.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the outbreak of the <em>COVID-19</em>
 epidemic, there have been more upward trends. Last summer, a maximum of <strong>7</strong>
 consecutive days was reached. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>5</strong>
 days in the same period. The maximum in the measured period is <strong>11</strong>
 days. We could use the average ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.23%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.59%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.2%</strong>
 and <strong>1.2%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports longer-term bullish sentiment, as the exchange rate creates higher lows and higher highs. This pair is in a short-term correction. However, we can clearly see a bullish divergence between the market price and the RSI. At the beginning of the month, the volumes were also above average. The <strong>AUD/USD</strong>
 is currently close to an important psychological level of <strong>0.7600</strong>
, which could be a support for this pair. In the event of a further decline, the longer-term moving average, the psychological level of <strong>0.7400</strong>
 and the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 could be a strong support for bulls.</p>

<Excerpt>The current price of the AUD/USD exchange rate is 0.7624 (April 13, 2021). This pair slightly corrected its longer-term upward trend last month. The Australian Dollar is highly correlated with commodities. It is currently trading close to an important level this year. Therefore, we will look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>The recovery of the US economy will be more significant than in the EU </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Fiscal stimulus in G20</h2>
<p>In the next graph, we can see a comparison of fiscal stimuli against the consequences of COVID-19 as a percentage of total GDP. Statista created this statistic as of 31.3.2021. It is, therefore, a fresh database. Fiscal aid from the US was significantly higher (26.46%) than aid from EU countries (11.14%). Nevertheless, some countries in the eurozone, such as Germany with 35.87%, put a lot into fiscal stimulus and aid. E.g., also France lagged far behind, and fiscal aid accounted for only 11.14% of its GDP. We can therefore see that there were significant discrepancies between fiscal aid between countries in the euro area but also in the EU. However, it should be mentioned that Germany could afford this aid, as it has been managing a surplus or a balanced budget responsibly for several years, which cannot be said of FR. Only in this example is it evident as a healthy budget and efficient management in good times is beneficial for states.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: Statista</span>
<h2>WEI</h2>
<p>America bet on the so-called Helicopter money and checks to American households and businesses. We may see slightly higher inflation, but it is likely to lead to better economic growth and consumption. It is also crucial how the vaccination process works in each country. Countries with more vaccinated populations are more likely to open up, so fewer businesses fail, and consumption can recover.</p>
<p>Vaccination, therefore, plays a key role in current economic developments. Another difference is speed. In the US, as a federation, it has its own budget and can react much more flexibly and quickly than the EU and the eurozone. Although it has its own specific budget, it does not have its "budget as one country." Each country has a different budget and a different state of public finances, and therefore the response of individual countries is very different and inconsistent.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WEI NY FED</span>
<h2>Prediction of real GDP growth</h2>
<p>Finally, we enclose a projection of the IMF (International Monetary Fund - IMF). Below we can also see the expected comparison of countries of individual economies. E.g. in 2021, the US economy should grow by 5.1 percent and in 2022 by 2.5 percent. The fact that the decline in real GDP in the euro area was more pronounced also awaits growth in 2021 and 2022, but smaller than in the USA. According to these data, it is clear that economically, the euro area is likely to move away from the US again. On the other hand, we can see China, which did not have such a significant economic drop in real GDP in 2020 and its outlook for the future is very optimistic. It is likely that China will overtake the US in nominal GDP this decade.</p>

<Title>Fundament of the week - ERC-20 Tokens</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>ERC-20 empowers developers</h2>
<p>One of the most prominent types of tokens is known as the ERC-20 and when it comes to token implementation, it has proven to be the technical standard used for all intelligent contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. As of April 16, 2019, there are more than 181,000 ERC-20 compatible tokens in the Ethereum core network.</p>
<p>The ERC-20 is crucial due to the fact that it defines a common list of rules that all Ethereum tokens must follow. That is why this particular token allows developers to predict exactly how the new tokens will work under the larger Ethereum system. The impact that the ERC-20 standard has on developers is therefore tremendous. In this case, there is no need to redesign or add support for each newly created token. They are designed to be compatible with the new tokens, provided that they also follow the rules set by the standard. Developers of new tokens generally follow the rules of ERC_20, which means that most of the tokens released through the initial coin offerings built on the Ethereum blockchain comply with the requirements of ERC-20.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/contract_eeeb23955c.jpg" alt="Different functions of Ethereum blockchain">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: The majority of the tokens running on the Ethereum blockchain are compatible with the ERC-20 standard</span>
<h2>6 functions that specify the ERC-20</h2>
<p>The ERC-20 is defined by six different functions in favor of other tokens in the Ethereum system. In general, these are basic functionality issues, including how tokens are transferred and how users can access specific token data.</p>
<p>Overall, this set of functions and signals ensures that Ethereum tokens of different types will work anywhere in the Ethereum system in an evenly distributed manner. Almost all digital wallets that support Ethereum currency also support ERC-20 compatible tokens. But because the ERC-20 standard is still relatively young, there are likely to be bugs that need to be tweaked as Ethereum is still maturing.</p>
<h3>Allowance</h3>
<p>The allowance function allows two addresses to create a repetitive one-way transaction channel. The owner's address and the recipient’s address are defined as two wallets that participate in recurring transactions. More specifically, the recipient will receive a certain amount from the owner's wallet at a certain interval. Both of these variables must be defined.</p>
<h3>Approve</h3>
<p>This feature is closely related to the previous one. It allows two addresses to repeatedly terminate a one-way transaction. Approve is a simple standard feature that allows the wallet owner to authorize the transaction he is making. This function requires two inputs, the recipient’s address and the number of tokens to receive. The output sends a Boolean value (0 or 1) that determines whether the transaction was allowed.</p>
<h3>BalanceOf</h3>
<p>Simply put, this function receives output from the address on the blockchain and returns a numeric output that indicates the number of tokens on the account. The Ethereum blockchain is public, so anyone can find out how many tokens are in any account.</p>
<h3>Total Supply</h3>
<p>This feature has been run only once, at the very beginning when the Ethereum network was being launched. The function is anonymous and, as the name suggests, it indicates the final number of tokens that can exist on the network.</p>
<h3>Transfer</h3>
<p>The transfer function is the most important function that ERC-20 tokens have. Defines and implements direct token transfers between accounts. The extent to which the function is initiated by wallet owners requires only two parameters. The recipient's address and the number of tokens the sender wants to send. The output of this function is a Boolean value that determines whether the transaction will take place.</p>
<h3>TransferFrom</h3>
<p>The last feature, TransferFrom, allows smart contracts to make a transaction based on the wallet owner's requirements. Not to be confused with the previous function, which is used only for direct transactions. However, this function is used to determine the conditions under which the transaction can take place. For example, stock exchange transactions or buying and selling tokens at a certain price are all performed using this function. The TransferFrom function has three basic input parameters, the sender's address, the recipient's address, and the number of tokens to be transferred.</p>
<h3>Solidity</h3>
<p>The most popular Ethereum client is written in the Google Go programming language. Developers usually choose those languages that are “smart contracts-friendly”. That is why they usually choose languages like Vyper, Bamboo, Serpent, and Solidity.</p>
<p>Solidity is a programming language focused on the work and implementation of smart contracts. Syntax Solidity is a combination of concepts from Javascript, Python, and C programming languages.</p>

<Excerpt>When it comes to tokens, there are simply no limits to the imagination. One could say that tokens are essentially smart contracts that use the Ethereum blockchain network. Today, let's talk about one of the most important token standards for the ETH network - the ERC-20.</Excerpt>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Technical Analysis of Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>What I have pointed out in previous articles has finally happened. Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high. The current maximum is almost <strong>$ 65,000</strong>
. My nearest target on the chart is <strong>$ 73,916</strong>
. It is also a target for rising wedge and triangle formations.</p>
<p>Bitcoin on the daily chart has two possible scenarios and both end at <strong>$ 70,000 - $ 73,000</strong>
. <strong>The first scenario</strong>
 is an ascending triangle that has been broken through upwards. The target for the ascending triangle is the mentioned limit of <strong>73k</strong>
.</p>
<p><strong>The second scenario</strong>
 is the rising wedge, which is not yet complete at this point, but in the medium term, it would mean that the moment we completed this pattern, we would have a bigger correction. However, I may elaborate on this topic in the future. In the coming days, we can still expect growth.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/technical_btc1_cbcd00e2a6.png" alt="technical analysis of Bitcoin on a daily chart">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Technical analysis of Bitcoin on a daily chart</span>
<h2>4H chart</h2>
<p>On the 4H chart, it would be ideal if Bitcoin could maintain the trend line and support at <strong>$ 61,750</strong>
. This support is our previous ATH (all-time high) and I would not like it to fall anywhere below this price level. From a long-term point of view and from the point of view of a trend, the key line for us is the trend line, from which we are quite far.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin had gone to the side for a while now, I would not be too surprised.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Technical analysis of Bitcoin on 4H chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Personally, I still believe that Bitcoin will exceed the <strong>$ 100,000</strong>
 mark this year. I still think cryptocurrencies have the best in front of them. This analysis showed us the levels that will be most important in the coming days. If these levels and trend lines are followed, the <strong>$ 73,000</strong>
 target is only a matter of time.</p>

<Title>XPD/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.48%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.53%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.75%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.70%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>1.34%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. Indexation is currently in the last growth phase of the cycle. Therefore, the scores are zero in both cases. That means that the bulls should wait for a better time before entering the position, or at least be more careful. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210416_cycles_b18f457185.jpg" alt="XPD/USD estimated cycles development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. The <strong>XPD/USD</strong>
 rebounded dynamically upwards in March. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, all MAs still support bullish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210416_Mo_M_54e3298ffb.jpg" alt="XPD/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Over the last month, we have witnessed more growing trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>6</strong>
 consecutive days. However, the total maximum in the measured period (last <strong>3</strong>
 years) is <strong>14</strong>
 days. The downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>2</strong>
 days in the same period. The maximum since the outbreak of the <em>COVID-19</em>
 pandemic is <strong>5</strong>
 days. We could use the average annual ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.72%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.73%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.0%</strong>
 and <strong>3.0%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210416_c_b8bfff4493.jpg" alt="XPD/USD daily return distribution">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>5.25%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210416_lh_eda88f593e.jpg" alt="XPD/USD low to high distribution">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to positive sentiment, as the price is currently testing the overall highs. The <strong>XPD/USD</strong>
 has broken above this year’s high, and if it continues to rise, the psychological level of <strong>3 000</strong>
 could be strong resistance. However, if the price does not break the maximum and on the contrary starts to fall, the next stop could be the psychological level at <strong>2 500</strong>
 or the demand zone (green rectangle), where the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 is also, along with a long-term moving average. In addition, a divergence between the price development and the RSI created in the last <strong>2</strong>
 months could support this scenario.</p>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: The Equilibrium project receives new funding on the Polkadot network</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Investors and EQ tokens</h2>
<p>Equilibrium CEO Alex Melikhov has announced new investors who have purchased EQ tokens. Among the many others, you can find names such as CMS Holdings, KR1, Genesis Block Ventures, Signum Capital. Does that mean Equilibrium will quite possibly be one of the parachains on Polkadot?</p>
<h2>Current numbers</h2>
<p>Alex Melikhov announced that Equilibrium's current market capitalization is around <strong>$ 320 million</strong>
. If Equilibrium manages to win a slot on the Polkadot network, its price could easily skyrocket.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/equilibrium1_929c418de8.jpg" alt="Equilibrium's DOT/EQ token swap">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Equilibrium's token swap announcement (source: Equilibrium Twitter account)</span>
<h2>Slot acquisition on the Polkadot network</h2>
<p>According to Equilibrium's analysis, about <strong>1 million DOT coins</strong>
 will be needed to obtain a slot on the Polkadot network. That amount of coins equals about <strong>$ 40 million</strong>
. And it is the aforementioned investors who are expected to invest this sum of money in order for the project to acquire one of the 100 slots.</p>
<h2>Equilibrium</h2>
<p>Equilibrium company is developing a decentralized interoperable market, which will have a large number of options and functions. Top analysts, developers, economists, and financial strategists such as Kyle Ellicott, Pablo Gabril, Yves Renno, Eric Wang, and others work on the project. Together, this team of people represents a huge knowledge base of the blockchain and financial sector, topped up with excellent marketing.
In the most optimistic view, Equilibrium is to be the number "1" in the DeFi world. As such, this ambitious project should have options like offering loans, borrowing, having maximum liquidity, or bridging loan processes across other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/equilibrium2_0964f8327c.jpg" alt="equilibrium logo">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Equilibrium logo</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Equilibrium itself is an ambitious project backed by a professional team with top knowledge of blockchain and the financial sector which is an excellent basis for the success of this company. A huge number of investors are aware of this, which is why Equilibrium is a hot candidate in the race to win one of the 100 slots on the Polkadot network. Investing in an EQ token can ultimately be an interesting option.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Equilibrium receives a $ 2.5 million financial injection on the Polkadot network. This means significant support and acceleration of the whole project. It is an ideal opportunity for Equilibrium to become one of the 100 parachains on Polkadot.</Excerpt>

<Title>The first hours of Coinbase on the stock exchange</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Reports of insider activity regarding COINBASE shares suggest that a higher number of early investors and executives sold billions in equity shortly after COIN shares were listed directly on the stock exchange. While the original reports initially indicated that much of the management had sold a high percentage of its stake in the company, a Coinbase representative said the sellers maintained strong ownership positions.</p>
<p>Data from capital market laboratories, confirmed by applications to Coinbase’s Investor Relations, show that insiders sold a total of <strong>12,965,079</strong>
 shares. Making it more than <strong>$ 4.6</strong>
 billion with the price of <strong>$ 344.38</strong>
 per share on Friday, April 16, 2021.</p>
<p>One of the significant transactions belongs to Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas, who has sold approximately <strong>255,500</strong>
 shares at a price of <strong>$ 388.73</strong>
 / share.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/coinbase_2_c42af6331d.jpg" alt="Ledger showing Coibase shares sale">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Table with listed major Coinbase shares sales</span>
<p>CEO Brian Armstrong sold <strong>749,999</strong>
 shares in three transactions at various prices, bringing the total to <strong>$ 291,827,966</strong>
. According to information released on Form 4, Armstrong will retain more than <strong>300,001</strong>
 shares worth more than <strong>$ 1 billion</strong>
 after the sale. However, a report from before Coinbase was listed said Armstrong owned <strong>36,851,833</strong>
 shares, indicating that he had sold just over <strong>2%</strong>
 of his stake in the company.</p>
<p>A representative of Coinbase stated that the percentages of each manager's assets are not accurately reported in this report and that revenues represent only a fraction of executive ownership and only a portion of inside information.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/coinbase_3_905e0e3f89.png" alt="COIN/USDT on 4H chart">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: 4H Chart of COIN/USDT</span>
<p>The news sparked sarcastic remarks on social media addressed at Coinbase management, with many observers likening the sale to a classic pump and dump, in which insider members flipped tokens into retail liquidity shortly after listing.</p>
<p>While the initial investors and executives were looking for collection options, there are also several major buyers. Hedge fund manager Cathie Wood is betting on Coinbase in bulk, buying shares worth more than <strong>$ 350 million</strong>
 for three different archival ETFs.</p>
<p>Likewise, many Coinbase employees now have a stake in the company, as <strong>1,700</strong>
 of them have been given <strong>100</strong>
 shares each as a token of gratitude.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Coinbase was embroiled in a series of negative headlines about Brian Armstrong’s new policy spree. It limited the focus on political and social issues in the workplace with Armstrong insisting that the company should remain focused on becoming a leading global brand that helps people convert digital currency to fiat currency and back.</p>

<Title>NZD/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.58%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.60%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.30%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.29%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was <strong>0.55%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>2</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the positive phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. The <strong>NZD/USD</strong>
 has continued to rise in recent weeks. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, all MAs still support bullish sentiment.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the outbreak of the <em>COVID-19</em>
 epidemic, there have been more upward trends. Last summer, a maximum of <strong>6</strong>
 consecutive days were reached. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>5</strong>
 days in the same period. The maximum in the measured period are <strong>7</strong>
 days. We could use the average ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.16%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.97%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.2%</strong>
 and <strong>1.2%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>2.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports longer-term bullish sentiment, as the exchange rate creates higher lows and higher highs. This pair was in a short-term correction in March after extreme volumes occurred. However, we can clearly see a bullish divergence between the market price and the RSI, which helped the pair rise again. The <strong>NZD/USD</strong>
 is currently close to an important psychological level of <strong>0.7200</strong>
, which could be a resistance for this pair. In the event of a decline, the longer-term moving average, the psychological level of <strong>0.7000</strong>
 and the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 could be a strong support for bulls.</p>

<Title>Fundament of the week: What is white paper and how is it written</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What is white paper?</h2>
<p>A white paper is an official document that is usually published in new blockchain projects before the ICO informs the public about the launch of new technology, methodology, product, or service. In order to become successful, each individual initial coin offer (ICO) on the market must include a white paper. It contains an outline of the problem that the project wants to solve plus a detailed description of their product, its architecture, and user interactions.</p>
<h4>The contents of any white paper should read, but not be limited to, the following points:</h4>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Disclaimer</li>
<li>Content</li>
<li>Market description and problem which project aims to solve</li>
<li>Product description and how to solve this problem</li>
<li>Tokens: how many, why, how, when, etc.</li>
<li>How the funds obtained will be used</li>
<li>Team of people working on a project</li>
<li>Roadmap - a plan that sets goals and deadlines for future project development</li>
<h2>How to compose white paper documentation</h2>
<p>The beginning of the white paper should be the filing of a legal notice or exclusion of liability, which should include all important restrictions or notices. This may involve exempting residents of certain countries from purchasing project tokens due to local laws, or simply informing future investors that the investment alone will not guarantee profits.</p>
<p>Probably one of the most important steps in writing almost any white paper is a <strong>compelling introduction</strong>
. A good step would be to present an introduction in the form of a letter from the CEO, addressed to future token holders. In this section, you need to outline the problem that your project intends to solve and provide an explanation of why this problem is important and what the consequences may be should it not be resolved.</p>
<p><strong>Project status</strong>
. This section should also include a detailed description of the current state of the project: prototype data, first users (if any), development strategy, and overall objectives. Most serious investors will only support projects that already have something to show because having an ecosystem and a user base will increase the chances of this project surviving in the market.</p>
<p><strong>Finance</strong>
. The author should be able to clearly explain why his project needs its own tokens, how and when they will be distributed when sales will start on the market, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Plan for the use of funds</strong>
. Investors need to know exactly where their money will go and how much of it will the project need to perform certain important tasks. The White Paper should make it clear that all the money raised will be spent on development and nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>Plan</strong>
. Finally, the white paper should contain not only a detailed technical description of the project but also a development plan. Ideally, a detailed work plan for the next 12-24 months should be submitted and should mention at least a date of beta launch.</p>
<p><strong>Team</strong>
. It is an inseparable and crucial part of the project and as such should be presented. With occasional exceptions, ICOs with the anonymous developer teams are scarcely successful.</p>
<p><strong>Style, language, and layout</strong>
. Formal to academic language should be used when preparing the white paper. The document must be very descriptive and professional. Its focus should be narrow, as it is better to choose one topic and focus on it. The authors of such documents quite often tend to deal with the ways of use and possible future implementations of their technology. In addition, the white paper should always be factual without assumptions, estimates, and unverified claims.</p>
<h2>Where is white paper often published?</h2>
<p>A few years ago, there were cases of successful ICO campaigns published in various Bitcoin forums, in which the white paper document itself was the first message in the whole thread. Currently, most projects have decided to publish a white paper on their websites. Other options are, for example, GitHub or other forums.</p>
<h2>Examples of well-written white papers and successful ICOs include:</h2>
<p>Ethereum - $ 15.5 million
Quoine - $ 105 million
DigixDAO - $ 5.5 million</p>
<p><em>Ethereum useless</em>
 - an ICO joke with probably the shortest white paper in the world, which consists of several sentences written and accompanied by the slogan <em>"Seriously, don't buy these tokens"</em>
. Interestingly, they earned $ 257,213 through their ICO.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Technical Analysis - Are we at the end of the bull market?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>On the daily chart, we see a clear decline from the rising wedge. This slump had everything it needed to have. It was unexpected, had a strong volume, was sudden and immediately broke all key levels. Basically, within a week we got to -25% of the value. But how to grasp this analysis and is the decline finally over? Unfortunately, no one knows. The only thing we can do on the chart now is to mark the strong supports as follows:</p>
<li>Support 44 974 USD</li>
<li>Support 41 030 USD</li>
<li>Support  29 800 USD</li>
<p>At this moment we are not even sure whether the fall has stopped, so we have nothing to base our analysis on. In order to do at least something, we need the price to stop and rebound. After that we need a higher minimum and higher maximum to appear. Only then will we be able to determine more.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Chart 1: Technical analysis of Bitcoin on a weekly chart</span>
<h2>4H chart</h2>
<p>As you can see from the chart, Bitcoin fell from $ 64,000 to $ 48,000. Overall, this is a drop of -25%. Be that as it may, this is not uncommon for cryptocurrencies. At this point, however, we are slowly approaching strong support, where I expect a response in the coming hours.</p>
<p>To be frank, I think that watching a 4H graph is not a completely correct approach right now, as we need to look at the market as a whole. For this reason, I would rather not analyze it further.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Chart 2: Technical analysis of Bitcoin on a 4H chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>From my point of view, this decline could really be expected mainly due to the fact that Bitcoin has been growing in the last 6 months. The whole crypto market was growing and people were already getting extremely greedy. Regardless, I don't think it should be the end of the bull-run, but rather its biggest current correction. All parameters confirm this statement. All we have to do now is give Bitcoin some time to recover and then we can analyze it further.</p>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: THORChain as a next DeFi promise</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>About THORChain</h2>
<p>THORChain has a goal of working as a cryptocurrency network and exchange for swapping different cryptocurrencies across different blockchains. One of its main technology advancements is a Bifrost Protocol, which is a crosschain bridge system that has one main job, which is to connect different chains together.</p>
<p>This model allows for movement across different assets and liquidity pools just by the usage of the RUNE token. RUNE also serves as a source of motivation for liquidity providers, who are receiving this token once they provide liquidity to any given pool, where the AMM is used to swap cryptocurrencies, instead of traditional order books. THORChain, just as many other DEXes, uses automated market maker solution (AMM), where the new native token of this exchange, RUNE, will be used and swapped.</p>
<h2>CLPs and RUNE token</h2>
<p>THORChain also improved a version of Bancor´s “smart tokens,” which is a technological feature that allows for purchasing and selling of them at any time. In the THORChain protocol, this feature was improved and renamed to Continuous Liquidity Pools (CLPs), and helps with exchange of the given assets and rewards the users that contributed to the liquidity pool. For this, the native token RUNE is used.</p>
<p>The token is therefore not only distributed as a reward for providing liquidity to pools, but it also gives a chance for owners to stake the assets and earn fees that are being accumulated from the different pools. However, this concept is not new, since many different DEXes use it, but it already proved to be an efficient way of distributing the native tokens, as well as making to project interesting for investors and stakers.</p>
<h2>History and technological developments</h2>
<p>The project officially launched in 2018, just like many other DeFi projects. However, it gained most of the attention late last year and early this year, when several projects of this type, such as Uniswap or Sushiswap, shined. However, one of the biggest flaws of projects of this type is making sure that enough liquidity is provided in the liquidity pools. Without it, swaps and exchanges would not be possible, which is one of the reasons why THORChain decided to used CLPs, where the need to find a buyer or seller is eliminated, leading to efficient swapping without frictions (depending on the liquidity).</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/Bifrost_protocol_tree_dd8c9780d0.png" alt="Bifrost protocol tree">
<span class="img-caption">Bifrost protocol tree, Source: medium.com</span>
<p>THORChain uses several improvements of already used technologies, which make this project really unique. One of them is for instance Tendermint-based chain, which was already used by Cosmos and helps with capping the number of validators. In combination with Bifrost Protocol, which is a cross-chain bridging system, and with Tendermmint-based chain and CLPs, it creates and secures bridges. Moreover, implementation of Yggdrasil Protocol that uses sharding to help with scaling of the whole project provides necessary speed and low transaction fees. To learn more about these technologies, do not hesitate to follow <a href="https://messari.io/asset/thorchain/profile#:~:text=THORChain%20is%20an%20independent%20blockchain,chain%20decentralized%20exchange%20(DEX).&text=It%20uses%20an%20AMM%20model,in%20a%20non%2Dcustodial%20manner.">this link</a>
, which explains it much more in depth.</p>
<p>This short introduction to THORChain, just like several our previous “DeFi Sunday” topics, is just a brief explanation of important concepts on a cryptocurrency project connected to decentralized finance that we find interesting. To learn more about it, check its <a href="https://thorchain.org/">whitepaper or official websites</a>
 and <a href="https://twitter.com/thorchain_org">social media</a>
, where you can study more about the possible impact and importance of THORChain.</p>

<Excerpt>THORChain is a new blockchain project that is build on Cosmos SDK, which should serve as a newly built decentralised exchange (DEX). However, this project combines several different technologies together, which brings a nice blend of features and options that help to differentiate it from others.</Excerpt>

<Title>XPT/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.03%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.07%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.53%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.50%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>2.18%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>1</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. Indexation is currently in a slightly positive phase of the cycle. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, we have witnessed more growing trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>6</strong>
 consecutive days. This is also the overall maximum for the last <strong>3</strong>
 years. The downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>5</strong>
 days in the same period. The total maximum in the measured period (last <strong>3</strong>
 years) is <strong>7</strong>
 days. We could use the average annual ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.65%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>3.02%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-2.5%</strong>
 and <strong>2.0%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>Basic technical analysis still supports medium-term bullish sentiment, as the price of a commodity creates higher lows and higher highs. The <strong>XPT/USD</strong>
 recently rebounded from the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
. This scenario could also support the divergence between price development and the RSI, which was created from November to March. Price level <strong>1 250</strong>
 may represent short-term resistance. After breaking this level, the psychological level of <strong>1 300</strong>
 can be tested. However, if the price does not break above <strong>1 250</strong>
 and, on the contrary, begins to fall, the next stop could be the psychological level at <strong>1 100</strong>
 or the demand zone (green rectangle), where the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>38.20%</strong>
 is also, along with a long-term moving average and another strong level of <strong>1 000</strong>
.</p>

<Title>Why was the price of cryptocurrencies dropping in the past few days? </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Current price movement of Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Past few days saw an inflow of bitcoins to the cryptocurrency exchanges, which usually leads to profit taking. For the last 6 months, Bitcoin and most of other cryptocurrencies have been constantly rising, which is a phenomenon that cannot last forever. This therefore led to taking of profits, which in many cases were probably more than hundreds of percent and in combination with few negative information, might have led to price correction.</p>
<p>April is usually regarded as one of the best months for cryptocurrencies, however, April 2021 looks to be different. As of now, Bitcoin is down around 10%, but for past few hours, it has been gaining back a lot of the lost profits. Therefore, next few days will determine whether April will be the first month since September that will close in red or not. Even if that does happen, the talks about end of the bull run might be a bit stretched.</p>
<p>This is in line with PlanB, for instance, one of the most famous Bitcoin analysts, who also created Stock-to-Flow model on Bitcoin. According to him, this is not the end of the bull run since Bitcoin still has a room to grow. Moreover, according to on-chain analytics during the latest dip, accounts with more than 1 million dollars have been buying, while accounts with less than 1 million dollars have been mostly selling. That would mean that in current times, mostly smaller investors (probably retail) have been taking profits.</p>
<p>They might have decided to do so after the Joe Biden tax plans have been officially released. The news about very high tax especially for the „richer ones“ affected almost all markets and therefore it would be reasonable to believe that this news also affected to cryptocurrency market.</p>
<h2>Dips, corrections, or bear markets – all are natural</h2>
<p>However, it is not very surprising to see movements like this in the cryptocurrency world. This market has always been rather volatile, and the prices tend to move much faster and much higher in percentage amounts than in other markets. Since the beginning of 2021, more than 3 price movements could be marked  as a „price corrections, dips or flash crashes“ with loss of more than 15%. These are not unique at all in this world. If anything, movements of plus or minus 15% are very mild for cryptocurrency markets, which is a reason why investors in this world need to account for steep price movements.</p>
<p>These all are, however, very natural. The markets need „rest“ or some breathing time, until they can start rising again, which is probably also the case of the price correction of past few days. Talking about the end of bull market just because we are not in the green numbers on daily or weekly candles, is a bit farfetched.  From the fundamental standpoint not much have changed in the past few days so there is no reason to believe that Bitcoin is in the bear market. And from the standpoint of the technical analysis, we will analyse the situation on Friday in our weekly „Bitcoin Friday“ article.</p>

<Excerpt>The cryptocurrency world has had a few turbulent days, which led to a correction that was viewed by few as an end of the bull run. Do the cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors really need to feel threatened by the past few days or was this just a healthy correction before BTC attacks the 100 000 dollars mark?</Excerpt>

<Title>GAMESTOP – Insane market </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>I think that almost everyone in the investment or trading world has heard about short squeeze and gamma squeeze, which occurred at "Reddit" stocks such as GME, AMC, KOSS, BB, etc. Gamestop is a company that is under no circumstances worthy of current valuations, and this Company has become the main target of speculators who have caused the collapse of a major hedge fund. However, something is not playing here...</p>
<h2>Valuation madness</h2>
<p>GME's revenue is declining year on year. It is entirely unrealistic for a company with $ 5-8 billion in revenue, negative profits, and especially no positive long-term outlook to have a market capitalization of $ 10 billion. A stock cannot be considered a growth stock or a value one.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/gme_trzby_ca58e155cb.png" alt="GME revenue">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Macrotrends</span>
<p>Although the Company earns money for its operations, it does not bring anything extra to its shareholders. Below we can see an overview of net profit (negative) for previous years. There is no bullish outlook insight.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/gme_zisky_45ea36c112.png" alt="GME net income">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Macrotrends</span>
<h2>Offering</h2>
<p>GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) ("GameStop" or the "Company") today announced that it had completed its previously announced "at-the-market" equity offering program (the "ATM Offering").
<strong>On April 5, 2021, GameStop disclosed that it had filed a prospectus supplement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to offer and sell up to a maximum of 3,500,000 shares of its common stock from time to time through the ATM Offering. The Company ultimately sold 3,500,000 shares of common stock and generated aggregate gross proceeds before commissions and offering expenses of approximately $551,000,000.</strong>
</p>
<p>Net proceeds will be used to continue accelerating GameStop's transformation and general corporate purposes and further strengthening the Company's balance sheet.
<strong>Earlier this month, GameStop disclosed that it issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to redeem $216.4 million in the principal amount of its 10.0% Senior Notes due 2023 on April 30, 2021.</strong>

This voluntary early redemption will cover the entire amount of the outstanding 10% Senior Notes, representing all of the Company's long-term debt.</p>
<p>For a normal company, a similar message is a very bearish sign, but clearly the opposite for GME.</p>
<h2>Opportunity?</h2>
<p><strong>From this point of view, I would certainly not short the GME classically. A classic short via CFD can be very risky because if another short squeeze or gamma squeeze came, you would probably have a massive loss.</strong>
 However, in the medium term (2-3 months), we have significant doubts that GME can be maintained at these or higher market cap levels. Yes, the price can go up to a thousand USD because the second wave of mania may come. However, this would be an excellent opportunity for hedge funds and other entities to make money on retail from our perspective. Hedge Funds will certainly not classically shorten GMEs for two reasons (via CFDs). The first is that they would risk too much, and the profit would be relatively small. The second reason is that they can be disposed of as they have been in the past. For this reason, there could be a perfect opportunity to go through option spreads for 2-3 months, either through a bear call spread or a bear put spread. You know how to manage the risk, and the profit can be much higher than if you traded CFDs.</p>

<Title>EUR/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.44%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.45%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.22%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.22%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was <strong>0.04%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>2</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the last growing phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. <strong>EUR/USD</strong>
 has been growing steadily in recent weeks. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, all MAs still support bullish sentiment.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, there have been more downward trends even after considering recent growth. In the first months, a maximum of <strong>3</strong>
 consecutive days was reached. However, the upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>2</strong>
 days in the same period. We could use the average ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.70%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.48%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.0%</strong>
 and <strong>1.0%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports longer-term bullish sentiment, as the exchange rate creates higher lows and higher highs. However, since the beginning of this year, it has been corrected. The last month could motivate the bulls again. In the short-term, this pair had very stable growth in April. However, we can clearly see a bullish divergence between the market price and the RSI, which could lead to an exchange rate correction. <strong>EUR/USD</strong>
 is currently close to an important psychological level of <strong>1.2100</strong>
. In the event of a decline, the long-term and short-term moving average and Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 could be the support for bulls. In addition, there is also the upper part of the demand zone (green rectangle).</p>

<Title>Fundament of the week: Double-spending Problem</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What is double-spending?</h2>
<p>Double spending is a potential problem in cryptocurrency ecosystems, where the same resources are spent by two recipients at the same time. Without adequate countermeasures, there is a fundamentally compromised protocol that will not solve the problem - users have no way of verifying that the resource they received has not been used elsewhere.</p>
<p>As far as cryptocurrencies go, it is extremely important to ensure that specific units cannot be duplicated. The whole system would be disrupted if, let’s say Alice could accept 10 units, copy them and add them 10 times to create 100 units. Such a scheme simply cannot work if it can send the same 10 units to Bob and Carol at the same time. For cryptocurrencies to work, there must be mechanisms in place to prevent this.</p>
<h2>How to prevent double-spending?</h2>
<h3>Centralized approach</h3>
<p>Implementing a centralized solution is significantly simpler than decentralized alternatives. This usually means that one supervisor who manages the system manages the issuance and distribution of units. A good example of a centralized solution to this problem is David Chaum's eCash solution.</p>
<p>The bank can use blank signatures to issue users with digitizing assets that mimic cash (capable of anonymous and equivalent exchanges) - as detailed by David Chaum, a cryptographer in the 1982 Blind Signatures for Untraceable Payments.</p>
<p>In this case, if the user (let's call him Bob) wishes to receive $ 100 in digital cash, he is obliged to inform the bank first. If Bob has enough funds in his account, the bank will generate a random number (or more numbers in case of smaller values). Suppose he creates five numbers, each of which is assigned a value of $ 20. To prevent the bank from tracking specific units, Bob obscures random numbers by adding a blind factor to each of them.</p>
<p>He then submits this information to the bank, which posts $ 100 to the account and signs reports confirming that $ 20 can be paid for each of the five pieces of information. Bob can now spend the funds issued by the bank. So he goes to a restaurant and buys a $ 40 meal.</p>
<p>Bob can remove the blind factor and expose a random number associated with each digital cash "receipt" that serves as a unique identifier for each unit (similar to a serial number). Two of these identifiers are revealed to a restaurant, which must immediately present them at the bank to prevent Bob from spending them at another merchant. Subsequently, the bank will check the validity of these signatures. If all goes well, the bank will credit the restaurant with $ 40.</p>
<p>Setting up Chaumov eCash solution can be useful for private transfers. However, it lags behind in terms of flexibility, as the bank is the central point of failure. The bill of exchange issued alone does not cost anything, because its value is derived solely from the bank's willingness to exchange it for dollars. Customers are at the mercy of the bank. This is a problem that cryptocurrencies aim to correct.</p>
<h3>Decentralized approach</h3>
<p>It is difficult to prevent funds from being spent more than once in the crypto ecosystem. Equivalent participants must coordinate a set of rules that will prevent fraud and motivate all users to act honestly.</p>
<p>The biggest innovation introduced in Bitcoin's white paper was the solution to this problem. Although not stated directly, Satoshi designed a structure that is currently commonly known as a blockchain.</p>
<p>Blockchain is really just a database with certain unique properties. Network participants (called nodes) run specialized software that allows them to synchronize their copy of the database with their peers. As a result, the entire network can audit transaction history extending from the genesis block. Public access to a blockchain makes it easy to detect and prevent fraudulent activities, such as double transactions.</p>
<p>When a user sends a transaction, it is not immediately added to the blockchain. It must first be included in the block through mining. Therefore, the recipient should consider the transaction valid only after it has been added to the chain. Otherwise, there is a risk of losing funds, as the sender can spend the same coins elsewhere.</p>
<p>Once the transaction has been confirmed, the coins cannot be spent twice because the ownership is assigned to the new user and the whole network can verify this. For this reason, many recommend waiting for confirmation from more nodes before accepting payment as valid. Each subsequent block drastically increases the amount of effort required to modify or rewrite the string (which can occur during so-called 51% attacks).</p>
<p>Let's go back to the scenario from the restaurant. Bob returns to the restaurant and this time he notices a "Bitcoin Accepted Here" sticker on the window. He recalls that he had enjoyed eating here last time, so he would order the same meal again. Only this time paying 0.00074  BTC instead of $ 40.</p>
<p>The restaurant will show him the public address to which he must send funds. Bob is sending this transaction, which is basically a signed report stating that the 0.00074 BTC that Bob owned now belongs to the restaurant. Anyone who came in contact with a transaction signed by Bob can now verify that Bob actually owned the coin and was authorized to send it.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, a transaction is valid only if it is included in a block that is confirmed. Accepting unconfirmed transactions is similar to accepting $ 40 in eCash from the previous example, but without immediate payment at the bank - in other words, it allows the sender to spend these funds elsewhere. Therefore, it is recommended that the restaurant waits for at least 6 confirmed blocks (which could take approximately one hour) before accepting Bob's payment.</p>
<h2>Double spending and Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is meticulously designed to prevent double-spending attacks, at least if the protocol is used as intended. This means that if individuals are waiting for a transaction to be confirmed in a block, there is no easy way for the sender to cancel it. To do this, they would have to "reverse" the blockchain, which requires an unrealistic amount of hashing force.</p>
<p>However, there are several types of double-spending attacks targeting parties that accept unconfirmed transactions. For example, for low-value purchases, the merchant may not want to wait for transactions to be included in the block. A busy fast food restaurant probably cannot afford to halt until the network confirms every purchase. Therefore, if the company allows "immediate" payments, it opens itself to possible double-spending attacks. Someone can order a hamburger, pay for it and then immediately send the same means to their address. With a higher fee, this new transaction is likely to be committed first and will therefore invalidate the previous transaction.</p>
<h3>There are 3 types of double-spending attacks</h3>
<p><strong>51% attack</strong>
 - once one entity or organization can control more than 50% of the hash value, they are allowed to exclude or change the order of transactions. This attack is very unlikely on Bitcoin, but has happened in other networks.</p>
<p><strong>Race attacks</strong>
 - two opposing transactions are sent sequentially using the same means - but only one transaction is confirmed. The attacker's goal is to cancel the payment only by confirming the transaction from which he benefits (for example, by sending the same funds to the address he is checking). These attacks require the recipient to accept an unconfirmed transaction as payment.</p>
<p><strong>Finney attacks</strong>
 - an attacker extracts one transaction into a block without immediately sending it to the network. Instead, he spends the same coins in another transaction and only then sends his previously mined block, which can invalidate the payment. These attacks require a specific sequence of events and are also conditional by the recipient accepting unconfirmed transactions.</p>
<p>As we can see, a merchant waiting for blocks to be confirmed will significantly reduce the risk of falling victim to double-spending.</p>

<Excerpt>One of the main problems of every cryptocurrency developer is the issue of double-spending. This refers to an event in which individual spends their cryptocurrencies more than once, thus creating differences between the expense record and the amount of cryptocurrency available as well as the way it is distributed.</Excerpt>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Technical Analysis of Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>I still have 2 strong supports marked on the daily chart, which have not been tested yet. We can see that after last week's slump, this week, Bitcoin has been growing. I do not think that this growth would lead to a new maximum - quite the opposite. I think this whole growth is just retracement after which Bitcoin will fall further. For me, the level of about $ 45,000 seems to be the strongest value. To make matters worse, weekly MA21 also oscillates around the level which was key for the entire bull market in the years 2016 - 2017.</p>
<p>I don't think this would be the end of the correction. I think Bitcoin will still continue further to the new low, but it will take a while. Bitcoin has been growing steadily since the price of $ 10,000 and has closed a green candle for 6 consecutive months, which is a lot even for Bitcoin.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Bitcoin on a daily chart</span>
<h2>4H chart</h2>
<p>On the 4H chart, the price arrived at the support, which was between $ 52,420 - 52,983. However, I admit that I now see two possible scenarios on the 4H chart, both of them having 50% probability. The first possible scenario is that price will test again at levels of $ 56,189 - 57,452. In that case, I might expect a new HIGH, but we would not be able to overcome this resistance. That would be final for us. As soon as we came to this resistance, there would be a decrease to the mentioned levels from the daily chart.
The second possibility is that Bitcoin will no longer test this resistance and go straight down. As a first stop, the level should be $ 50,739 - 51,411.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Bitcoin on a 4H chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you don't know what to do with Bitcoin, try to take a look at the daily chart. In my opinion, it speaks very clearly. We see noise in the 4H chart and it is more difficult to recognize other movements in this timeframe. Globally, however, I think we will witness a new LOW on the BTC.</p>

<Title>XAG/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.30%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.37%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.67%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.62%</strong>
.  Friday´s return was <strong>-0.70%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>2</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that in the case of indexation, we are in the last growth phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. <strong>XAG/USD</strong>
 broke over the short- and medium-term MAs this month. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, all MAs still support bullish sentiment.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the outbreak of the <strong>COVID-19</strong>
 pandemic, we have witnessed more upward trends that did not exceed <strong>5</strong>
 consecutive days. Downward trends also did not exceed more than <strong>5</strong>
 days in the same period. We could use the average annual ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.69%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.27%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3%</strong>
 and <strong>3%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>4.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis points to neutral sentiment in the last week. The <strong>XAG/USD</strong>
 is currently very close to the demand zone (green rectangle), where the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 is also. In addition, the shorter-term MA has also recently been very close to the spot price and acts as a support. Long-term MA is also approaching the price from below. This scenario could also support the divergence between price development and the RSI, which was created from December to April. However, in the event of a further decline, the psychological level of <strong>25.00</strong>
 can also be an important support.</p>

<Excerpt>The current price of XAG/USD - Silver Spot US Dollar is 25.90 (April 30, 2021). This commodity has been trading sideways in recent weeks, after rebounding from an important level in early April. Let us therefore look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>Twitter Falls On Slow User Growth – Worsened Outlook</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Twitter shares are falling sharply after the announcement of the results from the first quarter of 2021. Although it may not be a shot, the price reacts. Twitter managed to beat revenue estimates and EPS.</p>
<p>•	1Q Rev. $1.04B, Est. $1.03B
•	1Q Adj EPS 16c, Est. 14c</p>
<p>However, investors have narrowed the view to the growth of new users. Seven million new users have registered on Twitter and currently has 199 million daily users.</p>
<h2>Long term perspective</h2>
<p>Long-term growth in sales and gross profit is solid. I assume that Twitter still <strong>has excellent growth potential</strong>
, and therefore we can include it in Growth Stocks. The problem is still high costs and high monetization of the project. <strong>Twitter needs to increase its margin to make it significantly more attractive to investors in the long run.</strong>
 Financially, the situation is acceptable because it has a stable CF without significant fluctuations.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/twitter_data_018f5ffecb.png" alt="Twitter annual data">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Macrotrends</span>
<h2>What happened?</h2>
<p>The table below shows that Twitter recorded a year-on-year growth of new users by <strong>13% in 1Q / 2021 in the US. Yes, we will say tremendous growth, but it is the weakest growth since Q2 / 2019</strong>
. This is precisely the big problem for growth stocks. Once they miss expectations, a significant slump ensues. Internationally, this growth was 22%, which is a pretty decent figure. The potential, especially in international waters, is much more tremendous for Twitter.
The outlook for further user growth is not very optimistic: "Looking ahead, the significant pandemic-related surge we saw last year creates challenging comps, and may lead to mDAU growth rates in the low double digits on a year-over-year basis in Q2, Q3, and Q4, with the low point in terms of growth likely in Q2." Another crucial point is that Twitter announced a worsened outlook for 2Q sales. Initial expectations were in the range of 980 million - $ 1.08 billion for the quarter. <strong>The current estimate has reduced the top line to $ 1.05 billion</strong>
.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: Twitter via ZH</span>
<h2>Market reaction</h2>
<p>The market reacted very negatively. Twitter deleted 15 percent of its market value on Friday. <strong>From a statistical, very short-term point of view, the market is significantly oversold. The 50-day evolution of the graph attacks the 3rd standard deviation</strong>
. This has only happened twice since October 2019 and was an excellent buying opportunity. Another strong support is the EMA 200. The price is very close. From a very short-term perspective, another bullish signal represents a continuous 5-day (consecutive) decline. <strong>From this point of view, the USD 51-55 zone can represent a solid opportunity from a trading perspective.</strong>
 However, please note that the indices are overheated at the current stage to decline further. We expect testing of the band below and subsequent slight upward retrace. From this point of view, an option spread may be a good choice. However, we would like to point out in advance that this is under no circumstances investment advice, but only our analytical view.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: Patrik Mackovych via Tradingview</span>
<p>From an investor's (longer-term) perspective, we still consider the current prices to be slightly overvalued. Various valuation methods suggest that the stock is overvalued in the medium term.</p>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: Ethereum to 3 000 dollars supported by DeFi hype </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Ethereum is improving its position</h2>
<p>It is obvious that Ethereum is mainly gaining now due to the usage of DeFi protocols and solutions as well as due to the expected switch to Ethereum 2.0 (changing the consensus protocols from proof of work to proof of stake). All of these factors have definitely contributed to the fact that Ethereum is now attacking 3 000 dollars mark, with several pushes of ATH in the past weeks.</p>
<p>Solely in the past week, the cryptocurrency gained 30% of its value and is now sitting a bit below 3 000 dollars with ATH around 2 950 dollars at the time of writing. Its total market capitalisation is around 340 billion dollars, which is around 35 % of total Bitcoin market cap. This level is also one of the highest in past years. To put it into more perspective, Ethereum´s market cap is now bigger than market capitalisation of companies such as Nestle or Proctor and Gamble. Moreover it surpassed also a payment giant Paypal, and will probably also better the likes of Walt Disney or Bank of America very soon if it keeps this pace.</p>
<p>It is very clear that Ethereum is not going to get flipped by any other cryptocurrency in the near future, since the altcoin has strengthen its position as the second biggest cryptocurrency by market cap thanks to recent surge. Moreover, Binance Coin, which is third cryptocurrency by market cap is now „losing“ a bit of pace with ETH, but it had really good run at the past few weeks as well.
Both of these coins are mostly benefiting from the DeFi hype, since BNB, native token of Binance exchange, is connected to Binance Smart Chain, which is seen as a direct competition to Ethereum. It will be really interesting to see, how far these two projects in particular can rise on the DeFi hype, but it is very clear that the bull run for these projects is and will be very explosive.</p>

<Excerpt>The biggest altcoin, Ethereum, has been benefiting from the hype of the DeFi world for quite some time. But the latest surge in the price makes this altcoin really stand out.</Excerpt>

<Title>Buffett and Munger criticized Bitcoin again – their opinions will not make cryptofans happy</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Bitcoin is disgusting</h2>
<p>Last Friday, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger held traditional Berkshire Hathaway´s annual meeting for shareholders. At the Q&A session, they were asked about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, which was not a surprise. Their reaction, however, might have been a bit surprising. Especially Charlie Munger seemed to want to share his very strong opinions about this topic.</p>
<span class="post-quote">“Of course I hate the Bitcoin success. I should say modestly that I think the whole damn development is disgusting and contrary to the interest of civilization and I´ll leave the criticism to others.” </span>
<span class="quote-author">Charlie Munger</span>
<p>These words were strong enough to show, how critically and negatively they think about the cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin. While Buffett remained mainly silent about this topic or only agreed with these statements, Charlie Munger went as far as to say that he would never buy bitcoin as it supports kidnappers and extortionists. Moreover, he clearly stated that he is against supporting a currency or a financial product that is invented by someone out of thin air and is able to produce gains in billions of dollars.</p>
<h2>Hate towards cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>These opinions are not new at all. Bitcoin was called by these two legendary investors a “rat poison” or “gamble and speculation used by criminals” in the past. However, these new statements from Charlie Munger contained something that was not seen before. That was a real (and not very positive) emotion.</p>
<p>Hate is definitely not the best emotion when accessing investments or financial instruments, due to its ability to blind the analyst or make him subjective or less focused. However, since everyone knows that Munger and Buffett are not interested in cryptocurrencies or even in getting educated in this world, hate is not so surprising. It is known that Buffett and Munger never actually wanted to get educated about this field. It was supported again by the claims of Munger, who said on Friday that he will never buy or hold any Bitcoin.</p>

<Excerpt>Legendary investor and the “Oracle of Omaha,“ Warren Buffett and his closest investing friend and colleague, Charlie Munger, criticized cryptocurrencies again. This time though, Charlie Munger showed his real unhappiness with the situation in the cryptoworld.</Excerpt>

 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. In the case of monthly MA, <strong>GBP/USD</strong>
 is in bullish sentiment again, after getting above it. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, all MAs still support bullish sentiment.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, there have been more upward trends even after considering stabilization of the exchange rate. In the last month, a maximum of <strong>5</strong>
 consecutive days was reached. However, the downward trends in the same period did not exceed more than <strong>4</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.91%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.76%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.0%</strong>
 and <strong>1.0%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports bullish sentiment, as the exchange rate creates higher lows and higher high. However, <strong>GBP/USD</strong>
 is also currently close to the demand zone (green rectangle) with a strong bottom, where the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 is. There is also a bullish pattern of double bottom. In addition, the shorter-term MA has also recently been very close to and supportive of the exchange rate. However, the divergence between price development and RSI could motivate short-term bears after falling below the MA and the short-term psychological level of <strong>1.3800</strong>
.</p>

<Title>Fundament of the week: Byzantine fault tolerance</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>With a few exceptions, blockchains are intentionally designed to be decentralized, functioning as a digital ledger maintained by a distributed network of computer nodes. For this reason, blockchain technology has made it possible to create credible economic systems in which it was possible to carry out transparent and reliable financial transactions without the need for intermediaries. Cryptocurrencies are being accepted as a viable alternative to traditional bank payment systems, which are heavily dependent on trust.</p>
<p>Like a majority of distributed computing systems, cryptocurrency network participants must regularly agree on the current state of the blockchain, in other words, they have to reach a consensus. However, reaching a consensus on distributed networks in a way that is both secure and efficient is far from easy.</p>
<p>So how can a distributed network of computer nodes agree on a decision if there is a certain probability that some of the nodes will fail or act dishonestly? This is a fundamental question of the problem of the so-called Byzantine generals, which gave birth to the concept of Byzantine fault tolerance.</p>
<h2>What is the Byzantine generals’ problem?</h2>
<p>In short, the problem of Byzantine generals was conceived in 1982 as a logical dilemma that illustrates how a group of Byzantine generals may face communication problems as they try to agree on their way forward.</p>
<p>The dilemma assumes that each general has his own army with each of them being located in a different location in the vicinity of the city they intend to attack. The generals must agree on either an attack or a retreat. It does not matter if they attack or retreat unless all the generals reach a consensus on what to do next.</p>
<h4>Therefore, we can consider the following requirements:</h4>
<li>Each general must decide: to attack or retreat (yes or no)</li>
<li>Once the decision is made it cannot be changed</li>
<li>All generals must agree on the same decision and act in a synchronized manner</li>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/byzantine_35eed252f0.PNG" alt="byzantine generals dilema">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Byzantine general dilemma</span>
<p>The above-mentioned communication problems are related to the fact that each general is able to communicate with the other only via messages forwarded by the courier. Therefore, the central challenge to the problem of Byzantine generals is that messages may be delayed, destroyed, or lost in some way.</p>
<p>In addition, even if a message is successfully delivered, one or more generals may choose (for whatever reason) to act in a malicious manner and send a fraudulent message to confuse the other generals, leading them all to complete failure.</p>
<p>The only way to reach a consensus on these types of distributed systems is to have at least ? of reliable and honest network nodes. This means that once the majority of the network decides to act maliciously, the system is prone to failures and attacks (for example, 51% attack).</p>
<h2>Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT)</h2>
<p>Simply put, Byzantine fault tolerance is a feature of the system that is able to withstand the failures not dissimilar to the problem of Byzantine generals. This means that the BFT system is able to continue to operate even if some of the nodes fail or act maliciously.</p>
<p>There is more than one possible solution to the problem of Byzantine generals and thus more ways to build a BFT system. Likewise, there are different approaches to blockchain to achieve Byzantine error tolerance, which leads us to so-called consensus algorithms.</p>
<h2>Blockchain consensus algorithms</h2>
<p>The consensus algorithm can be defined as the mechanism by which a blockchain network reaches consensus. The most common implementations are Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). Take Bitcoin as an example.</p>
<p>While the Bitcoin protocol prescribes the primary rules of the system, the PoW consensus algorithm is what defines how these rules will be followed to reach a consensus (for example, when verifying transactions).</p>
<p>Although the concept of Proof of Work is older than cryptocurrencies, Satoshi Nakamoto developed a modified version of it as an algorithm that allowed the creation of Bitcoins as a BFT system.</p>

<Excerpt>Since the invention of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system in 2008, many other cryptocurrencies have been developed. Each with a specific mechanism. But one thing that almost all cryptocurrencies have in common is the blockchain as a major element of their architecture.</Excerpt>

<Title>Is the COVID-19 crisis in the US over?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Real GDP</h2>
<p>From a real GDP perspective, this may look like it will be in the US after a while and that in a few months (the next quarter), it will even be able to beat real GDP in billions of dollars compared to 2019. Real GDP is adjusted for inflation, meaning it provides a much more reliable overview of the economy's overall performance compared to nominal GDP. However, we should rely only on this indicator to evaluate the state, respectively. Recovery rate?</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/real_gdp_20577aa736.png" alt="Real GDP in Billions of Dollars">
<span class="img-caption">Source: MishTalk</span>
<h2>Employment and Non-Farm Payrolls</h2>
<p>A very important indicator of the economy is also the employment or unemployment rate. The current unemployment rate in the US is 6%. Before the pandemic, the US unemployment rate was 3.5%. However, "Non-farm payrolls" are also crucial in the US. This indicator measures the change or status of employed people. It monitors monthly how many jobs are being created (outside the farming sector).</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/nonfarm_fcc3cf5578.png" alt="Nonfarm Payrolls">
<span class="img-caption">Source: MishTalk</span>
<p>In the following graph, we can see two key indicators. The orange color represents the development of corporate profits after tax. Here we can confirm that many companies have managed to reach new levels again after a severe loss of income. We can apply this to the American market, but it cannot be completely generalized. This is because, e.g., restaurants, cruise ships, hotels, airlines, and others are stagnating, but many technology giants have improved. The situation in the USA is slowly getting into normal. Vaccination also has a great deal of credit for this, thanks to which the release continues.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: Patrik Mackovych | Walfir</span>
<p>The blue curve on the right axis shows the household savings rate. Although the data are still from March, the essence is preserved. The savings rate may be lower, but the high savings rate may be reflected in the growing consumption of Americans in 2021-2022. This could also support the country's GDP. However, it should be noted that the pandemic largely influenced this factor. Still, it should not be forgotten that a certain percentage of respondents said they would use a large part of checks (fiscal incentives) to fund bank accounts.</p>
<h2>Buffett Indicator</h2>
<p>Finally, we point out an exciting indicator from the legendary investor W. Buffett. This gives the ratio of the total market capitalization (in the US) compared to US GDP. Currently, this ratio is at the level of 204% and expects a negative return on the stock market of -3.7% in one year at current valuations. If we put the ratio market capitalization vs. GDP + The assets of the US Federal Reserve are thus also relatively high, at almost 150%. State comparable to the dot-com bubble in the years 1999 - 2000.</p>

<Excerpt>In this article, we will summarize some facts that monitor the development of the US economy and whether it is reaching pre-pandemic levels. So far, we can say that the fiscal and monetary stimulus discussed in the previous article was probably sufficient to revive the US economy. Of course, along with crucial vaccination.</Excerpt>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Technical Analysis of Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>On the daily chart, we see that Bitcoin has been going to the side for some time. A rising wedge pattern has been formed from which Bitcoin eventually went down. It was not a fatal and fundamental dump by any means necessary, but rather a classic correction. So Bitcoin has not made a new high in a while and it basically continues to the side.</p>
<p>For me, the two strongest supports are at <strong>$ 40,687</strong>
 and <strong>$ 45,216</strong>
. After falling out of the falling wedge a harder dump came followed by another growth. Now the price is stagnating. Personally, I think that growth came only as a retracement and a reaction to a decline. I do not think that Bitcoin should go to a new maximum straight from this point. Rather than that, I think that Bitcoin will continue going sideways or will begin descending, hitting all the marked supports on its way down. I am not particularly fond of the whole daily chart. However, this situation suits altcoins and ETH. While the current situation around Bitcoin is kind of boring, altcoins are exceeding their maximums and money is now flowing into them. Of course, this phenomenon will not last forever and will soon turn around again. At the moment, however, we can enjoy the altcoin season.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Bitcoin on a daily chart </span>
<h2>4H chart</h2>
<p>This chart is no fun at all. Let me put it bluntly, if there was just this chart and nothing else in front of me, I would not be able to read anything from it. There are so many scenarios that can happen that it makes it nearly impossible to correctly assume which one is the probable one. In the chart, we can see the emerging triangle, which belongs to an indecisive pattern. With this pattern, it is really 50:50. Even after looking through the scope of all the basic indicators, it seems that we are still in the neutral zone. The 4H chart will tell us almost nothing. Therefore, it is very important to look at the daily chart, where we see the "bigger picture".</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, Bitcoin is currently stagnating and altcoins are reaching new highs. Therefore, in the following days and weeks, I would pay particular attention to altcoin, because it definitely makes more sense now.</p>

<Title>XCU/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.25%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.20%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.63%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.58%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>3.18%</strong>
, which is more than the <strong>1st</strong>
 standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>3</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that in the case of indexation, we are in a very positive growth phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. <strong>XCU/USD</strong>
 broke over the short-term MA in April. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, all MAs still support bullish sentiment</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the outbreak of the <strong>COVID-19</strong>
 pandemic, we have witnessed more upward trends that did not exceed <strong>11</strong>
 consecutive days. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>5</strong>
 days in the same period. The most negative trend in the last <strong>3</strong>
 years reached <strong>12</strong>
 consecutive days just before the decline of global markets in <strong>2020</strong>
. We could use the average annual ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.68%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.78%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-2.5%</strong>
 and <strong>2.5%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports bullish sentiment, as the price of a commodity creates higher lows and higher highs. <strong>XCU/USD</strong>
 is currently very close to the all-time highs around <strong>4.6500</strong>
. The shorter-term MA has very well supported the spot price for the last year. In addition, there is still high upward momentum. However, the divergence between price development and the RSI could motivate bears. In such a case, the demand zone (green rectangle) could be a strong support, where are also the psychological level of <strong>4.0000</strong>
 and the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
.</p>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: DeFi now locks twice as much ETH as is held on exchanges</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>DeFi significantly reduces the ETH offer and thus pushes its price up</h2>
<p>The rate at which the relatively young DeFi industry is booming is attracting the attention of an increasing number of investors. The volume of <strong>ETH, which is locked in smart contracts, is still growing</strong>
 and has increased by an incredible 75% since since the beginning of 2020. On the other hand, the number of ETH held on exchanges is constantly declining and has decreased by 30% over the same period. The statistics were shared with the chart by on-chain data provider Glassnode.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Glassnode - Ethereum: Supply in Smart Contracts vs. Balance on Exchanges, Source: glassnode.com</span>
<p>The share of ETH offer allocated on centralized exchanges thus decreased from 17% to 12% and the share of ETH locked in DeFi smart contracts increased from 13% to 22.8%. According to DeFi Llama, up to <strong>9% of ETH are locked out of the Ethereum mainnet.</strong>
 The largest part is on Binance Smart Chain, which operates with more than 8 million ETH, representing up to 7% of the total circulating supply.</p>
<p>In addition, just a few hours ago, <strong>ETH managed to create a new ATH at almost $ 4,000,</strong>
 and ETH futures trading volumes even outpaced the BTC market for a period of time.</p>
<h2>The Bank of Japan is interested in DeFi, while identifying the opportunities and risks</h2>
<p>The Bank of Japan has recently issued a report focusing extensively on the DeFi industry. They concluded that DeFi has the potential for rapid growth in Japan and can create financial services that will meet the needs of a new users generation.</p>
<p>The report quite clearly <strong>identifies the potential benefits of DeFi.</strong>
 The most important are, for example, increased competition in the financial sector and better availability of financial products and services. Of course, they did not omit the <strong>analysis of potential risks</strong>
 and focused on criticism of regulatory frameworks, failures of poor quality smart contracts and complications associated with the protection of completely anonymous consumers.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>The DeFi industry is still growing and the volume of Ether (ETH) locked in DeFi smart contracts has far surpassed the number recorded by crypto exchanges. It is clearly a bullish signal, which is also supported by the new Bank of Japan report, which took a closer look at the whole sector.</Excerpt>

<Title>ETH surprised the market due to its activity over the weekend</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Ether (ETH) has crossed the $ 4,000 mark for the first time in history and the bulls are celebrating</h2>
<p>Last weekend, the market was full of expectations regarding the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, which was originally created as a joke, but is currently enjoying huge (though not fact-based) interest from investors and traders around the world. It failed to reach the goal of $ 1.00 and, conversely, its price fell by 30%. Much more positive days are behind for the cryptocurrency <strong>Ether, which currently creates one ATH after another.</strong>
 At the time of writing, <strong>its price is $ 4,170 and total market capitalization has exceeded $ 480 billion.</strong>
</p>
<p>Ether has not only had a successful weekend, but also shows its strength in the appreciation for the last week, which represents 41% in price appreciation. In the past month it more than doubled its value. Many analytical companies report the <strong>interest of institutions as the main driver of this strong growth.</strong>
 In addition, Ether is pushing up by many projects that are working on its blockchain Ethereum. Only yesterday,<a href="https://investro.com/crypto/de-fi-sunday-de-fi-now-locks-twice-as-much-eth-as-is-held-on-exchanges"> in this article,</a>
 we mentioned that twice as many ETHs are locked in DeFi smart contracts as are recorded on centralized exchanges, which of course significantly reduces its offer and pushes the price up. It is certainly worth mentioning that the NFT sector, the digital world of art, is also one of the main drivers of the ETH price growth.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/ether_eth_chart_coinmarketcap_ed8d589b9d.png" alt="Rise of the price of Ethereum">
<span class="img-caption">Ether (ETH) price chart, Source: coinmarketcap.com</span>
<p>In addition, the mentioned growth comes at a time when we are <strong>expecting interesting news on its blockchain. One of them is the EIP-1559 update</strong>
, which should lead to a reduction and stabilization of fees in this chain and, of course, a <strong>huge transition of the entire network to the Proof-of-Stake system.</strong>
 These fundamental changes may have a very significant effect on the future of ETH price.</p>
<h2>Can Ether also attack the significant dominance of Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>Ether recorded an <strong>increase of more than 350% during 2021</strong>
, significantly outperforming Bitcoin with a gain of 90%. Therefore, many analysts expect ETH to show us other new highs this year. Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, predicts that ETH will attack Bitcoin's dominance later this year.</p>
<span class="post-quote">"Compared to (BTC), Ethereum is more scalable, offers more uses and solutions, such as smart contracts which are already used across many sectors, and is backed with superior blockchain technology."</span>
<span class="quote-author">Nigel Green, deVere Group CEO</span>

<span class="img-caption">Ether (ETH) coin, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>Ether's price predictions for 2021 indicate the <strong>continuation of the ongoing bull run, in which ETH could reach the level of $ 5,000.</strong>
 With this limit, already underway, less conservative analyzes come into play and speak about $ 10,000, or even $ 50,000 level. Eventhough it seems to be a bit much, the sentiment in the market is currently very positive and ETH can be very surprising as we already saw many times.</p>
<h2>Not everyone is happy with the rocket growth and the new ATH</h2>
<p>Anyone who has recently bet on a drop in the price of ETH has lost their funds. According to the data, <strong>more than $ 77 million was liquidated</strong>
 in this way, and the best-known crypto exchange Binance alone recorded liquidations of short positions worth $ 11 million. In addition, the aforementioned update of EIP-1559 will result in the burning of part of the transaction fees, which will lead to a further reduction in the ETH offer and the bears are therefore unlikely to have a very pleasant period ahead.</p>
<p>We are currently witnessing a situation where the <strong>number of ETH withdrawals from exchanges is significantly higher than the number of deposits</strong>
 and this means that no large price declines should take place. In addition, just nearly $ 400 million in stablecoin Tether USDT was sent to the market in a short time, indicating that someone might be going to buy a large volume, and we will be watching into which cryptocurrency this volume will be reflected.</p>

<Excerpt>Ethereum reached a new ATH over the weekend, which even reached $ 4,200 today. It seems that it has still not stopped growing, so we are yet see what else it shows in terms of price. What is this growth driven by and what can we expect in the future?</Excerpt>

<Title>USD/JPY statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.45%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.44%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.22%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.22%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was <strong>0.12%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently negative (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-2</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that the periodic change is close to its average and indexation in the slightly positive phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. In the case of monthly MA, <strong>USD/JPY</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment again after falling below it. As we can see in the chart below, the longer-term MAs are still in bullish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210511_Mo_M_6b198d6334.jpg" alt="USD/JPY daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the beginning of <strong>2021</strong>
, there have been more upward trends, where we have also recorded a medium-term maximum of <strong>6</strong>
 consecutive days. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. However, the maximum decrease was <strong>7</strong>
 days in the measured period. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.56%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.57%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1%</strong>
 and <strong>1%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis shows a stabilization phase between <strong>108.00</strong>
 and <strong>110.00</strong>
 or Fibonacci retracement levels of <strong>61.80%</strong>
 and <strong>78.60%</strong>
 in the last <strong>2</strong>
 months. The <strong>USD/JPY</strong>
 is currently in the demand zone (green rectangle), where there is also the short-term moving average that is acting as resistance now. However, the divergence between pair development and the RSI that has been created since the beginning of this year could motivate bulls and push the exchange rate above the demand zone.</p>

<Excerpt>The current price of the USD/JPY exchange rate is 108.63 (May 11, 2021). The pair has returned to an important zone in recent weeks. It is currently still traded there. Let us therefore look now at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>The rise in inflation exceeds analysts' expectations </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>As a result, however, core inflation rose by <strong>2.96 percent compared to last year, the highest since 1996</strong>
. However, what is probably more important is that the month-on-month growth of the Core CPI was 0.92%, the highest since 1981.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/cpi_ac693defb4.jpg" alt="Core CPI rose 2.96%">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Zerohedge</span>
<p>The classic CPI also grew very significantly. Year-on-year growth is 4.2%. In this case, it means the most significant increase since June 2008. But let's look at what was behind this increase.</p>
<p>We can see that "core services" have probably found their bottom and are growing, which we can partly attribute to growth. <strong>However, it is precisely energy prices that are causing inflation to rise.</strong>
 In the chart below, we can see that the rise in energy prices and commodity prices are the cause of the majority of inflation.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/cpi_composition_27bd94d639.jpg" alt="CPI composition">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Zerohedge</span>
<p>Inflation growth is positive for the economy and debt. However, if more than medium-term, inflation as low as 4% will force the central bank (Fed) to pursue a more restrictive monetary policy. For this reason, it may be negative for stocks and bonds, as quantitative easing programs may end before 2022. This is likely to be the case only if inflation remains at similar levels.</p>
<p>Moreover, with current inflation, it would be logical for us to see an increase in yields on (US) government bonds, mostly with medium to long-term maturities. However, we do not see this more significantly. We believe this is because the market either unfairly values bonds or counts current inflation as transitory. As yields are not rising more significantly, but inflation is, real yields are falling to new lows, which means that the general conditions for financing/refinancing remain very attractive.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/real_yields_138719e1af.png" alt="Real yields">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Tradingview</span>
<p>In conclusion, we can say that general well-being, resp. <strong>living standards may fall</strong>
. We say this because real average hourly earnings decline the most in the period under review. The Fed is closely monitoring inflation and is unlikely to make hasty decisions before employment improves.</p>

<Title>The fundament of the week: What is a genesis block?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The so-called Genesis, the original block containing the first 50 BTCs. This block, unlike any of the 502,000+ blocks that followed, was carrying a message written by Nakamoto: <em>"The Times 03 / Jan / 2009, Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks".</em>
</p>
<p>This line is the exact copy of the London Times article title written on 3rd January 2009, which in detail describes the banks bailed by the British government. While Nakamoto never clarified the true meaning of this message, many interpreted it as a reference to why Nakamoto developed Bitcoin - to erase banks and intermediaries that he considered corrupt and unreliable and subsequently creating a currency that is oriented at its users, the people.</p>
<p>The origin of the Genesis block, like Nakamoto himself, is shrouded in mystery. However, several questions come to mind. For example, why the BTCs in the original block remain inexhaustible, why the next block lasted 6 days, and why users still transfer BTCs to the Genesis block.</p>
<span class="post-quote">The Hash of Genesis block (000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f) is unique because it contains two more leading hex zeros than other starting blocks require.</span>
<h2>Bitcoin Genesis block</h2>
<p>The 50 BTC reward from the genesis block was sent to 1A1zP1eP5QGefo2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNA address and as of January 3, 2019, this address contains a total of 66,912 BTCs and received a total of 1486 transactions. The block fee of 50 BTC will remain inexhaustible forever and also the users who have sent their BTC to this address will never be able to recover them back.</p>
<p>Although the average time between BTC blocks is 10 minutes, the timestamp of the block following the Genesis block is a full 6 days. One of the interpretations states that Satoshi worked on BTC for some time and the article headline from The Times challenged him to publish his project. He then extracted the Genesis block so that the timestamp matched the title.</p>
<p>It is also possible that, given the low hash value of the block, Satoshi could spend 6 days mining it with the same timestamp and then proceeded to block 1. The hypothesis suggests that this block was resolved on January 3, but using this block the software was tested by Satoshi Nakamoto, not until January 9. At that moment, all test blocks were deleted and the Genesis block was reused for the main network.</p>
<p>Source: binance.vision, investopedia.com, en.bitcoin.it</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>In 2009, more precisely on January 3, an unknown developer (or group of developers) named Satoshi Nakamoto began writing history by releasing the so-called Genesis block on the Sourceforge server.</Excerpt>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Musk sends Bitcoin under $ 50,000.</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>This week, the crypto world was shaken by the information that TESLA will stop accepting Bitcoin for its vehicles due to the complexity of mining. How did it affect the charts?</p>
<h2>Weekly chart</h2>
<p>On the weekly chart, the weekly MA21 has been tested since 21.09.2020. This moving average was absolutely crucial for the entire bull market in 2016 and 2017. Bitcoin always tested it as it grew, but had never broken it downwards. Now, however, it has been an unusually long time since Bitcoin has tested the moving average during its continuous growth. It did not happen until this week. Now it is absolutely crucial for Bitcoin to not close the weekly candle under this MA, which is worth <strong>$ 47,670</strong>
.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Technical analysis of Bitcoin on a weekly chart</span>
<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>It was E. Musk’s tweet that caused Bitcoin to fall through the trend line. In addition to the weekly MA21, I have drawn a support line on the daily chart at the level of <strong>$ 46,429</strong>
, which would fit perfectly with this MA. In addition, I have a more pessimistic scenario here, and that is testing the level of <strong>$ 41,627 - $ 43,137</strong>
.</p>
<p>However, we can temporarily reach these levels with a wick, but we should not close the weekly candle on these levels. That would be very bad for further development.</p>
<h2>4H chart</h2>
<p>On the 4H chart, we basically see the same price development as on the daily chart. It will be absolutely crucial how we will close this week. This will tell us a lot about the strength of Bitcoin in the following few days.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Technical analysis of Bitcoin on a 4H chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As I said in previous analyzes, Bitcoin already needed a correction. When it seemed that there was no correction in sight, E. Musk stepped in and helped it with his tweet. In the following days, however, It will all depend on the weekly candles and whether we can maintain weekly MA21.</p>

<Excerpt>This week was very turbulent on the cryptocurrency market which led to a significant move in a single direction. As I mentioned in previous analyzes, I did not see much room for growth at BTC and the recent market movements had confirmed that notion.</Excerpt>

<Title>XAU/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.77%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.77%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.40%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.36%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>0.86%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>3</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. The change is very positive in this case and the indexation is currently in the last growth phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. <strong>XAU/USD</strong>
 is in bullish sentiment in the case of monthly and 6 months MAs, after rising above it in recent days. As we can see in the chart below, the annual MA still supports bearish sentiment and currently acts as a resistance to the spot price.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210515_Mo_M_7dcd1c9364.jpg" alt="XAU/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Recently, we have witnessed more upward trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>4</strong>
 consecutive days. However, the maximum increase was <strong>8</strong>
 days in the measured period. Since the beginning of <strong>2021</strong>
, the declining trends have not exceeded more than <strong>5</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.56%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>1.25%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.6%</strong>
 and <strong>1.6%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>2.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis still supports short-term bullish sentiment, as the exchange rate has been creating higher lows and higher high since March. <strong>XAU/USD</strong>
 is currently very close to the important psychological level of <strong>1 850</strong>
, where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>38.20%</strong>
. In addition, the long-term moving average acts as a resistance. The divergence between price development and the RSI, which has developed since the beginning of this year, could support the bearish scenario. If the price starts to fall, the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50%</strong>
 and the short-term moving average could be a strong support.</p>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: The industry is pushing cryptocurrencies above 2% of the global money supply</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Don't look at Shiba Inu and similar cryptocurrencies, the future is in DeFi</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency news are literally flooded by information about Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), Safemoon (SAFEMOON) and similar other "cryptocurrencies". However, according to Delphi Digital, we should focus more on the decentralized finance sector, which is constantly gaining momentum. <strong>Institutional investors</strong>
 are also increasingly interested in DeFi and are beginning to perceive the potential for high returns on Bitcoin, altcoins and stablecoins. The cryptocurrency market currently accounts for more than 2% of the total global money supply, and DeFi industry is making a significant contribution to this figure. Bitcoin accounts for almost half of this volume and the rest is in hands of other sectors and projects, including DeFi.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Cryptocurrency percentage of total global money supply, Source: Delphi Digital</span>
<p>Most of DeFi's growth is due to Ethereum blockchain projects, notably the <strong>Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Solana (SOL), Avalanche (AVAX), Polygon (MATIC) and Terra (LUNA)</strong>
 ecosystems. These currently cover 34% of the total value locked in DeFi.</p>
<h2>The key infrastructure is based around stablecoins</h2>
<p>According to Delphi Digital, native DeFi stablecoins play an important role in DeFi growth and currently account for nearly $ 10 billion of the total market cap. <strong>The largest DeFi stablecoin is DAI,</strong>
 which covers $ 4 billion in capital and <strong>the fastest-growing is UST,</strong>
 the stablecoin of the Terra ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Individual DeFi ecosystems are gaining strength relatively quickly</h2>
<p><strong>Binance Smart Chain</strong>
 is one of the fastest-growing DeFi ecosystems. Its development is, of course, significantly accelerated thanks to Binance's almost unlimited resources. The investments enable the creation and launch of quality native protocols and the largest ones include PancakeBunny (BUNNY), Venus (XVS) and PancakeSwap (CAKE).</p>

<span class="img-caption">DeFi - Concept of blockchain, decentralized financial system, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p><strong>The total value locked in</strong>
 these protocols is nearly <strong>$ 50 billion,</strong>
 and all first-layer ecosystems have so far exceeded $ 130 billion in cumulative total value locked (TVL).</p>
<h2>The well-known company Huobi Group comes with huge support for the sector</h2>
<p>Huobi Group is one of the largest blockchain companies in the world and, among other things, is behind the well-known crypto exchange with the same name - Huobi. They recently announced that they <strong>will launch a new subsidiary, Huobi Ventures,</strong>
 which will cover their investment activities.</p>
<p>According to information, Huobi Ventures will manage a <strong>portfolio worth $ 100 million</strong>
 and should invest mainly in blockchain and <strong>DeFi projects in the initial stages.</strong>
 To date, Huobi has invested $ 69 million in hundreds of projects and the estimated balance of their portfolio is $ 215 million.</p>

<Title>Environmental impact: Why we should not look only at cryptocurrencies</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrencies are currently experiencing a price drop, and many analysts attribute this to Elon Musk. He only recently stated that his company, Tesla, will stop accepting Bitcoin payments. The reason for this is supposed to be its impact on the environment. For the purpose of this article, we decided to omit the fact that Musk is becoming to be known for deliberately influencing the prices of cryptocurrencies through similar statements, which he then uses to his financial advantage. We would rather look at what <strong>most debates completely omit - comparing the consumption of Bitcoin with the consumption of the banking system and the consumption of the gold mining industry.</strong>
</p>
<h2>Yes - Bitcoin consumes a lot of electricity and certainly has a negative impact on the environment, but ...</h2>
<p>Bitcoins´ power consumption is relatively easy to monitor. With tools like the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, you can even track it real-time. A study by Galaxy Digital estimates that <strong>Bitcoin together consumes approximately 115 TWh per year.</strong>
 This number includes the consumption of mining, pools and also the consumption of individual nodes. To put this into perspective, whole energy production is around 160 000 TWh, with up to 50 000 TWh lost due to energy inefficiencies. Compared to this, Bitcoin is only a drop in the ocean. It must also be said that we do not know exactly the share of renewables used to produce energy for the operation of Bitcoin. However, it is economically most advantageous for miners to look for the cheapest possible energy, and therefore especially for energy from surpluses and renewable sources.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/world_energy_consumption_by_source_60d3fe587e.webp" alt="World energy consumption by source">
<span class="img-caption">World energy consumption by source, Source: BP Statistical Review of World Energy</span>
<p>Using the current global average of approximately 0.6 tonnes of CO2 per kWh of electricity produced, <strong>Bitcoin mining emits 70 million tonnes of CO2 per year.</strong>
 In a broader view, it is certainly necessary to compare this number with the "competition" of Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>Let's look at consumption and the environmental impact of gold mining</h2>
<p>To calculate energy consumption in gold, Galaxy Digital has implemented estimates of total emissions in the industry from a report by the World Gold Council entitled "Gold and Climate Change: Current and Future Impacts." It is estimated that <strong>this industry consumes approximately 240 TWh of energy per year.</strong>
 Moreover, this number is far from total, as gold is associated with a number of other processes in its refining and processing.</p>
<p>The fundamental difference we see compared to Bitcoin is the fact that <strong>gold mining leaves huge devastated areas in the world,</strong>
 which will probably never return to their original state. In 2020, approximately 3,500 tonnes of gold were mined worldwide and another 1,300 were recycled. According to Dell, each <strong>kilogram of gold mined consumes almost 50 MWh of energy and produces 20 tons of CO2.</strong>
 In the jewellery industry, which takes 50% of the world's demand for gold, these numbers are even higher, reaching 35 tonnes of CO2 per kilogram of gold and up to 80 MWh per gram. Together, <strong>this industry consumes almost 270 TWh of energy per year and produces 145 million tons of CO2.</strong>
</p>
<h2>The banking sector really can't blame Bitcoin</h2>
<p>In the comparison of these 3 sectors, the bank gets to the first (worst) place and therefore the attacks of its representatives towards Bitcoin are literally ridiculous. It is estimated that its data centres, bank branches, ATMs and data centres of card companies together **consume almost 270 TWh of energy per year. **However, this is a very simplified estimate and <strong>some reports show a value of up to 700 TWh per year,</strong>
 which represents <strong>up to 400 million tonnes of CO2.</strong>
</p>
<p>These numbers are very difficult to estimate, as the current financial system includes a number of separate sectors that are directly involved in its functioning. In the estimate, we do not include, for example, the energy used to produce banknotes and coins, nor the materials themselves (plastics, metals and paper) used to produce them.</p>
<h2>The final evaluation is likely to surprise critics of cryptocurrencies in particular</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/bitcoin_mining_energy_consumption_6f938bd571.jpg" alt="Bitcoin mining energy consumption">
<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin mining energy consumption, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>As the mentioned studies and their numbers clearly show us, <strong>Bitcoin is more than good compared to the competition.</strong>
 If we (in theory) stop gold mining today and completely replace the banking sector with cryptocurrencies, energy consumption would ultimately fall. This would, of course, also reduce CO2 production.</p>
<p>In addition, cryptocurrencies and their miners are economically motivated to make the most of waste energy and renewables. <strong>As of now, Bitcoins´ consumption is half of what we estimate for the gold industry and one-fifth of the estimate for the banking sector.</strong>
</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>The energy consumption of cryptocurrencies and their impact on the environment is increasingly being discussed around the world. This is currently one of the biggest point of criticism. However, an important comparison with the current banking system, or the gold mining industry, is often forgotten.</Excerpt>

<Title>USD/CHF statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.46%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.48%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.23%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.24%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was only <strong>0.14%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>2</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>1</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we could soon see the strengthening of the bulls due to the rising phases of the cycles. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the end of March, there have been more downward trends. In the last year, we also recorded a medium-term maximum of <strong>9</strong>
 consecutive days. Upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>5</strong>
 days in the same period. However, the maximum decrease was in the measured period of <strong>7</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.67%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.60%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1%</strong>
 and <strong>1%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports bearish sentiment as the exchange rate creates lower highs and lower lows. However, we can clearly see the divergence between the market price and the RSI that has been forming since the beginning of this year. Volumes have been above average in recent days. All moving averages are above the exchange rate. <strong>USD/CHF</strong>
 is currently also close to the demand zone (green rectangle) with a strong lower part, where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
. In addition, there is also a strong psychological level of <strong>0.9000</strong>

 could be potential support for the exchange rate in the event of a further decline.</p>

<Title>Crypto sell off: What just happened?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Huge sell off and huge retracement - for now</h2>
<p>With Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Binance Coin and almost all other cryptocurrencies losing huge amounts and creating new lower lows, the main question is, what happened to the whole cryptocurrency market? This kind of movement, where all the cryptocurrencies would decrease so significantly so fast, was probably seen last year during the Covid-19 crisis, where all the markets tanked. Ever since then, most of the cryptocurrencies have bagged huge profits and the retracement, correction, sell off or even flash crash (call it what you want) of Covid-19 like volume and speed was unimaginable to happen any time soon.</p>
<p>However, markets are unpredictable, which proved to be true again today. With Bitcoin going below 30 000 dollars, Ethereum below 2 000 dollars or Binance Coin hitting 280 dollars, cryptocurrency market once again proved that it is one of the most volatile markets. All of TOP cryptocurrencies, and many more, have already erased was majority of losses, with huge wicks on the 4H and daily charts.</p>
<h2>Combination of bad news</h2>
<p>The probable reason for this sell off was a combination of all different kinds of bad news. These included Tesla turning their backs to Bitcoin as payment method for its products, Musk being very negative and articulate about his views on shortcomings of cryptocurrency sector and Bitcoin as such or newly imposed rules in China that are going to prohibit companies to offer any cryptocurrency-related products and services.</p>
<p>Moreover, the markets have not seen such a correction in past several months and have risen significantly in that period of time, which according to some, was only a bubble-like behaviour and hype or overly optimistic sentiment. Therefore, for bullrun to continue, this type of correction movement is necessary, in order to be able to give some space for retraction of all the overheated indicators as well as to calm the overall sentiment down.</p>
<h2>Do not panic</h2>
<p>Movements such as the one visible today are not something new in the cryptocurrency world. This sector is still extremely volatile with very small market capitalisation compared to other financial instruments and therefore can be easily "manipulated." However, it is important to keep in mind that during corrections such as this one, markets can be very volatile to both directions and that it is not the best strategy to be selling out of fear. Appropriate strategy, risk and money management are always necessary for all investors, since they have the ability to not only protect your financial wealth, but also emotional well-being.</p>
<p>Therefore, having appropriate stop losses or limit orders should always be in order and in cryptocurrency world, which is still considered very risky. It is also important to only invest money, that you are fine to lose, since cryptocurrencies are still new asset class that needs to establish itself in the markets properly (not a financial advise).</p>

<Excerpt>Vast majority of cryptocurrencies is in red numbers today. And we do not mean losses of few basis points or few percents. Most of the cryptocurrencies have lost more than 20% today , with even some of the bigger ones losing more than 30-40%. Why did this happen?</Excerpt>

<Title>Silver – Statistically negative returns ahead</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Seasonality</h2>
<p>On the next graph, we can see the average development of silver for individual months since 2000. The best months in terms of seasonality are January, February, July, August, and December. The worst are April and June, as well as November. Perhaps a statistical indicator - the median - is more credible.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: Patrik Mackovych | Walfir</span>
<p>The next graph shows the development of investments  (blue) vs. global supply minus investment by the SRSRocco Report. Demand for 2021, I note only after March 2021, was almost greater than the entire investment demand in 2018. Investment demand is relatively high, given only the first-quarter data. Investment demand is expected to remain strong throughout 2021. That's not all. In addition, it has awakened significantly, and industrial demand continues to awaken. It fell more significantly in 2020 due to lockdowns and interrupted production. In 2021, however, a significant start is expected in this respect as well.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: SRSrocco Report</span>
<h2>Fear of inflation</h2>
<p>Another big scarecrow for investors is INFLATION and inflation expectations. It has been growing significantly recently, mainly in the USA, where it grew by 4.2% last week compared to the previous year. The question is whether the rise in inflation is temporary and will end this year, or have the increase in the money supply, monetary and fiscal stimuli caused a steady upward trend in inflation? In our opinion, this is a temporary increase. And even if not, monetary policy can adapt the instruments to this.</p>
<p>The fact that there is a fear of inflation in the USA is also being monitored by Google, which reports multiple searches for the word "inflation". Precious metals or silver, which can be considered a "hybrid" of precious metal and industrial metal, also respond positively to rising inflation. Similarly, gold and other precious metals. However, the best correlation with inflation is not precious metals, but industrial metals such as copper, etc.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/cpi_composition_6ded7a6b9d.jpg" alt="CPI YoY Composition">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Zerohedge</span>
<p>If we look at the structure of inflation, we can see that the biggest behind this growth are the energy prices, which are growing most significantly. Other CPI components are also growing, but less so.</p>

<Excerpt>Silver has been able to recover in recent weeks. This is due to a growing economy globally after the pandemic, a significantly strengthened manufacturing sector, and inflation expectations and inflation, which are still rising.</Excerpt>

<Title>The fundament of the week: Internet of Things (IoT)</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>In the literature, as well as on the Internet, we find countless definitions. This is evidenced also by the number of slightly different definitions of IoT given in <em>Towards and the definition of the Internet of Things (IoT) Revision 1 - Published 27 MAY 2015</em>
. This only proves the fact that the IEEE (The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) has not defined a standard to this date. Simply put, the Internet of Things thus still has several definitions.</p>
<h2>What is the Internet of Things</h2>
<p>The Internet of Things uses Internet Protocol (IP), the same protocol that identifies computers throughout the Internet, and allows them to communicate with each other. The goal of the Internet of Things is to have devices that behave the same in real-time, improve their efficiency, and deliver key information faster than a human-dependent system.</p>
<h2>Advantages of IoT</h2>
<p>IoT promises to change a wide range of areas. For example, in medicine, interconnected devices can help professionals monitor patients both inside and outside of the hospital facilities. Computers can then evaluate data to help physicians tailor treatment and improve the outcome of treatment.</p>
<p>Another area that is undergoing transformation is urban planning. For example, if you place sensors with their own IP address under a busy street, the relevant authorities can warn the driver about an impending delay or potential accident. Meanwhile, AI waste disposal bins can inform the waste disposal facilities as soon as they are filled, thus optimizing waste collection routes.</p>
<p>The use of smart devices is also likely to give a competitive edge to businesses that use them strategically. For example, by monitoring data on energy consumption and inventory levels, a company can significantly reduce its overall costs. Interconnection between companies and their consumers can also help companies in doing their business more efficiently.</p>
<p>By monitoring consumer behavior in the store premises, a retailer could theoretically sell recommended products directly tailored to its customers, thereby increasing the overall sales volume. If an IoT appliance is in the consumer's home, it can alert its owner about the need for a service and easily recommend him to book an appointment.</p>
<h2>Disadvantages of IoT</h2>
<p>As with all personal data problematics, many personal data protection issues need to be addressed in the context of IoT, which is the biggest problem. This technology has advanced much faster than the regulatory environment, so companies that continue to expand their Internet-enabled devices face potential regulatory risks.</p>

<Excerpt>To this day, we see the term Internet of things almost on a daily basis. It is attributed to Kevin Ashton of Procter & Gamble, who used the phrase in a 1999 article to describe the role of RFID tags in increasing supply chain efficiency.</Excerpt>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Technical Analysis of Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Before we start with an update on the current situation, let's take a brief look at the history. Bitcoin had been growing at a record pace in recent months resulting in 6 consecutive months of growth candles. To put it in numbers, it was a continuous increase from $ 9,000 to a record $ 65,000, which is also the current ATH. Following such a brutal growth, it was only a matter of time before the correction would take place.</p>
<h2>Weekly chart</h2>
<p>This week, Bitcoin fell from $ 46,000 to $ 29,000. It has thus fallen to more than a 50% of its ATH. Some altcoins have even dropped by more than 70%. However, this was to be expected after such extreme growths. But what is next?</p>
<p>I would expect the correction to continue on the weekly chart. At this point, I cannot say whether this was absolute bottom or a new one is yet to come. However, I think Bitcoin is bound to create some side structure in the form of triangles or ABC corrections.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Chart 1: Weekly Bitcoin chart</span>
<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>Looking at the daily chart, we can see that the growth ended with a rising wedge, which is a reversing pattern. From this pattern, we went up to the value of $ 29,000 in the form of an ABC correction. So we tested a strong level and confirmed it as a support. The whole structure would be absolutely fine, if it was not for a massive drop that came within 24 hours and caused a great deal of panic. Have we reached this level in a bit more slowly manner, no one would have batted an eye.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Chart 1: Daily Bitcoin chart</span>
<h2>What next?</h2>
<p>After such a sharp fall, we have to wait for a reaction. A current weekly candle could tell us a lot. At this point, however, we cannot determine the next development, because we have nothing to build our assumptions on. However, I do not think that the bull market on cryptocurrencies would end for several reasons.</p>
<li>Quantitative easing and incentives are still ongoing</li>
<li>Stock to flow model remains intact</li>
<li>Volumes are still relatively high</li>
<li>Media and companies are still way too interested in the cryptocurrency world for this bullrun to be over</li>

<Excerpt>This week will be the one that will go down in history. We have witnessed one of the biggest plunges in the crypto market. What actually happened and what impact will it have on the whole market? Could this be the beginning of the bear market?</Excerpt>

<Title>Crude oil (WTI) statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.77%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.96%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.92%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.94%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>2.47%</strong>
, which is above average, but still within the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-1</strong>
 for price indexation. It is currently in a slightly negative phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210521_Cycles_7d6844f0c9.jpg" alt="WTI daily price indexation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. <strong>WTI</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment in the case of the monthly MA, after falling below it recent days. As we can see in the chart below, the 6 months and annual MAs still support bullish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210521_Mo_M_707eb7ec39.jpg" alt="WTI daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, we have witnessed more upward trends, the maximum level of which has reached <strong>7</strong>
 consecutive days. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>4</strong>
 days in the same period. However, the maximum decrease was <strong>11</strong>
 days in the measured period. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.74%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>3.61%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.6%</strong>
 and <strong>3.6%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>6.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis still points to a slightly positive sentiment with a sideways price development in recent months. The <strong>WTI</strong>
 is currently very close to the short-term moving average and the psychological level of <strong>60.00</strong>
. This could be strong support for bulls. In addition, this scenario could be supported by a divergence between price development and the RSI created since April. Rising inflation could bring the price to a psychological level of <strong>70.00</strong>
. However, if there was a further drop below <strong>60.00</strong>
, the next stop could be the demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
, along with the psychological level of <strong>50.00</strong>
 and the long-term moving average.</p>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: Coinbase makes DeFi access easier with a new extension</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Chrome integration promises to make DeFi easier to access for mainstream users</h2>
<p>Decentralized finance is still a relatively complex issue for many users, despite a huge increase in interest. <strong>The main problem is still the user interface and handling of individual applications,</strong>
 which discourages a large number of cryptocurrencies fans. This is one of the reasons why Coinbase is <strong>trying to simplify access to DeFi</strong>
 through its wallet application and new extension.</p>
<p>Until now, Coinbase Wallet has required relatively complex QR code scanning to access, for example, decentralized exchanges. According to the new information, this is over and users of this wallet will <strong>be able to interact with DeFi through an extension in the Chrome browser,</strong>
 which works similarly to MetaMask.</p>
<h2>One million users on the way to decentralized exchanges, thousands of cryptocurrencies and NFTs</h2>
<p>The chief product manager said that wallet users can now access various dApps through a <strong>one-time setup through Chrome.</strong>
 However, he added that they would continue to receive a notification on the phone requesting verification of the transaction, which is an important security feature given the risks associated with storing private keys in a browser add-on.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Coinbase Wallet download, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<span class="quote-author">"The new extension allows for instant access to dApps on desktop — after linking your Wallet account to the extension once, you are free to browse all dApps with one click. This includes accessing thousands of cryptocurrencies, trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXes), earning interest, and collecting NFTs. "</span>
<p>The Chrome extension is said to be part of the company's <strong>larger goal of increasing the availability of DeFi for mainstream users.</strong>
 Coinbase openly admits that the current experience with DeFi is not ready for the mainstream, but believes that this will change significantly in the near future. In addition, Coinbase Wallet already has a <strong>million users</strong>
 who are sure to enjoy these reports, and the company is likely to bring a lot of new ones. Coinbase also declares its interest in education in this area so that their customers can obtain information about the wallet itself and its access to the DeFi sector.</p>
<p>MetaMask remains the most popular extension of Chrome, and Coinbase has to contend with competitors such as My Ethereum Wallet (MEW) and Rainbow in this field.</p>

<Excerpt>The electronic wallet of the well-known cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase comes with a new extension for the Chrome browser. According to the company, the goal is to facilitate access to decentralized applications and decentralized finance for many of their users.</Excerpt>

<Title>A fundamental partnership? Tron and BSCPad present a new platform</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Both sides are professionals in the world of cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p><strong>TRON is one of the largest blockchain protocols</strong>
 in the world and currently has more than 3 million transactions executed daily. They enjoy huge interest, especially in Asian countries. The cryptocurrency TRON (TRX) is its flagship and its total market cap is more than $ 5 billion. The most prominent personality of this company is certainly its founder Justin Sun, who is also the CEO of BitTorrent - the most popular torrent client in the world.</p>
<p>In the case of <strong>BSCPad</strong>
, we are talking about the largest launchpad, which was created only this year in March. In this relatively short period, they have already boasted <strong>several successful IDOs.</strong>
 The activity of BSCPad certainly contributed significantly to the enormous growth of their home Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which recorded the emergence of up to 21 million new electronic wallets over the same period.</p>
<h2>IDOs represent an interesting opportunity for investors and projects in the early stages</h2>
<p>The IDO concept has seen increased interest from investors, especially during the last bull run, and is a <strong>decentralized form of the initial offering.</strong>
 According to an official press release, the Tron Foundation and BSCPad will <strong>soon launch their IDO platform TRONPad.</strong>
 The aim is to bring an important element of decentralization to the initial offerings on the TRON chain, which will provide investors with equal and fair opportunities to obtain cryptocurrencies of interesting projects.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/bscpad_joins_forces_with_tron_to_release_tronpad_848f30004e.png" alt="BSCPad joins forces with TRON to release TRONPad">
<span class="img-caption">BSCPad joins forces with TRON to release TRONPad, Source: binancewiki.com</span>
<p>According to the published information, TRONPad should share the ideology of BSCPad, which means that they will strive to <strong>ensure that every cryptocurrency enthusiast can participate in the IDO,</strong>
 and not just a certain upper percentage of large investors. This intention was also emphasized by Justin Sun himself and he also highlighted the BSCPad team.</p>
<span class="post-quote">“The BSCPad team is very strong and knowledgeable, they consist of some of the top players in the space. We are looking forward to taking this collaboration to new heights ... As the hyperadoption of crypto continues to explode, TRONPad will serve as a fair IDO platform for projects launching on the TRON blockchain.”</span>
<span class="quote-author">Justin Sun, Founder and CEO of Tron Foundation </span>
<p>Co-Founder BSCPad added that they are very happy to be able to work together to create the very first native platform on one of the largest blockchain networks. They believe that they will provide users with a fair platform for obtaining tokens of new projects. <strong>TRONPad also wants to avoid any manipulation, robots and favouring a certain group of investors.</strong>
 Blockchain space currently often operates on various private offerings, VCs and companies that invest in projects before the retail and thus gain a significant advantage.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>The "initial offers" have undergone a significant transformation in past few years, and one of the currently most interesting is the so-called IDO - Initial DEX Offering. It was in this offer that joined two blockchain giants, the Tron Foundation and the popular BSCPad launchpad that decided to collaborate, creating a new IDO platform - TRONPad.</Excerpt>

<Title>Investro Tea: Week #21</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h3>G7 and regulations</h3>
<p>The intergovernmental organization of states with the greatest economic power, G7, is negotiating about proposing uniform, worldwide taxation of multinational internet corporations such as Alphabet or Facebook.</p>
<p>According to current discussions, the minimum level of taxation should be 15%, with the result of the negotiations being available as early as June. However, it must be said that G7 resolutions are not legally binding. You can read more about the meeting on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/g7-is-close-agreement-taxation-worlds-largest-companies-ft-2021-05-24/">Reuters</a>
.</p>
<p>If you are interested in the G7 itself and its global impact, you can read about it on the European Union’s website. Link <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/farming/international-cooperation/international-organisations/g7_en">here</a>

<span class="img-caption">Flags of all G7 states. Source: Flickr.com, Creative Commons</span>
<p>The question remains, how these large internet companies will react and whether will they start looking into outer space, following the example of other corporations.</p>
<h3>Musk, Branson, Bezos and Space Tourism</h3>
<p>Musk’s SpaceX is not the only private company with a space program. Billionaire Richard Branson has similar plans, and his company, Virgin Galactic, has successfully launched its own space shuttle called VSS Unity. The shuttle reached 89 km above the Earth’s surface and then successfully landed thus marking another step towards private space tourism programs.</p>
<span class="post-quote">"It was a beautifully elegant experience...Now, we have made a huge step in the right direction,”</span>
<span class="quote-author">Sir Richard Branson</span>
<p>We must not forget that neither the owner of Amazon, Jeff Bezos, is being idle and wants to send his New Sheppard rocket into space on July 20.</p>
<h3>IoT and the future</h3>
<p>As we can see, the world is changing faster than it may seem. The Internet of Things is no longer just a crazy sci-fi idea, but a reality that we, the investors, should take into account.  Take a look at the basic advantages and disadvantages of the Internet of Things concept in our <a href="https://investro.com/crypto/the-fundament-of-the-week-internet-of-things-io-t">article</a>
.</p>

<Title>USD/CAD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.41%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.41%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.20%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.20%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was only <strong>-0.14%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently very positive (<strong>3</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>3</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in a very positive phase of the cycle according to both scorings that range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to all MAs, <strong>USD/CAD</strong>
 is in a bearish sentiment because it is below all of them. In the case of growth, the monthly MA could be the first important resistance for the exchange rate.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210525_Mo_M_01c4037cb3.jpg" alt="USD/CAD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>There have been more downward trends since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. At the beginning of this year, the medium-term maximum of <strong>5</strong>
 consecutive days was reached. Upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. The maximum in the measured period is <strong>7</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.71%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.42%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-0.9%</strong>
 and <strong>0.9%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.40%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports bearish sentiment as the exchange rate creates lower lows and lower highs. However, we clearly see the divergence between the market price and the RSI. <strong>USD/CAD</strong>
 is also currently approaching a very important psychological level of <strong>1.2000</strong>
. In addition, the volumes were higher on positive days (highlighted in red ellipses). Short-term MA could be the first resistance if the bulls pushed the price higher. Another could be the supply zone (red rectangle), where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 and the psychological level of <strong>1.2600</strong>
. In the case of a further drop below <strong>1.2000</strong>
, we could see a dynamic movement or the creation in the form of a bear trap.</p>

<Excerpt>The current price of the USD/CAD exchange rate is 1.2060 (May 25, 2021). This pair continues to fall sharply after our last analysis on April 30. It tests an important medium to long-term psychological level, which has acted as a strong support in the last 6 years. Let us therefore look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>XPEL – Statistics say: short term opportunity is here</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The company has a network of trained installers and proprietary DAP software dedicated to exceeding customer expectations by providing quality products, customer service, technical support, and world-class training.</p>
<p>The company has significant investment potential in the long run, mainly due to its strong core business, strong, profitable ranking, and secure financial position. However, even though it is a stable-growth company, valuations are directly screaming, and the current extreme may signal the opposite situation. Short-term extremes say that with good risk management, it is possible to open a short position. However, I would like to point out in advance that this NOT investment advice, but only our analytical view, which is purely informative.</p>
<h2>Extremes in many ways</h2>
<p>From a statistical point of view, a very short-term opportunity may arise. The market is significantly overbought in the short term as well the medium term. So we can say that investing in this great company at current prices can bring a negative return in the coming months. XPEL traded for $ 10 a few months ago and is currently at around $ 82-83. Its profits and sales did not grow as significantly as the share price. Although the company has a strong financial position, just for this reason, we can say that such significant growth is unjustified from our point of view.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/chart_69c1a5bec4.png" alt="XPEL price chart">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Tradingview</span>
<p>In the next graph, we can see that extreme situations occur on the daily chart. The market has been growing for 6 days in a row, while from a statistical point of view, after 5-7 days of continuous growth, a few percent decrease came about. The average nominal decline in USD is -7.8 USD after such corrections. So if we were to set a target from that point of view, it could be somewhere close to 75-77 USD. On the one hand, this is quite a conservative target, but on the other hand, you need to have stricter risk management, because you are trading against the main trend.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/daily_extremes_7304e77136.PNG" alt="XPEL extremes">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Patrik Mackovych | Walfir via Tradingview</span>
<p>In the next chart, we can see the medium term extreme in the form of the historically highest Price-to-Sales ratio, which is at the level of 12.4. This is significantly overshot. Moreover, a correction will likely come in the medium term. As for the percentage deviation from EMA 50 is not so significant. For this reason, too, we prefer a more conservative approach. Deviation from EMA 50 represents approximately 25% above the long term average, but not entirely in the reverse position. In this case, Price Action is excellent, as today's session opened with a significant gap, the stock grew by about 10%, but the bulls failed to maintain this growth. At the end of the session, it reaches only 1-2%, which is more negative in the short term.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: Patrik Mackovych | Walfir via Tradingview</span>
<p>In summary, we can therefore say that the condition of short-term extremes has been met, so that in this case, from a statistical point of view, a short-term decline is more likely. However, again, we note that this analysis represents only our view and is not an investment advice.</p>

<Title>Fundament of the week - What is staking?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>To better understand what staking is, you must first understand how proof of stake (PoS) works. In short, it is a consensus mechanism that allows blockchains to operate in more energy-efficient extraction while maintaining a decent degree of decentralization (at least in theory).</p>
<h2>How does staking work?</h2>
<p>As we already know, Proof of Work blockchains relies on mining which is adding new blocks to the blockchain. In contrast, Proof of Stake blockchains produce and validate new blocks through the staking process. Staking refers to validators who lock their coins so that they can be randomly selected by a protocol at certain intervals in order to create a block. Participants who deposit larger amounts usually have a better chance of being selected as the next validator block.</p>
<p>This allows the production of blocks without relying on specialized mining hardware, such as ASIC. While ASIC mining requires significant investment in hardware, staking requires direct investment in the cryptocurrency itself. Therefore, instead of competing in terms of computational work, PoS validators are selected based on the number of coins they insert. "Stake" is what motivates verifiers to maintain network security. Failure to do so may endanger their entire share.</p>
<p>While each Proof of Stake blockchain has its own specific deposit currency, some networks use a dual-stream system where the rewards are paid in a second token.</p>
<p>At a very practical level, a deposit means only keeping funds in a suitable wallet. This allows virtually everyone to perform different network functions in exchange for certain benefits. It may also involve adding funds to staking pools.</p>
<h2>How is staking calculated?</h2>
<p>Each network of blockchains can use a different way of calculating staking rewards. Some are adjusted block by block, taking into account various factors. These may include:</p>
<li>How many coins the validator inserts</li>
<li>How long the validator has been actively trying</li>
<li>How many coins are inserted into the net together</li>
<li>Inflation rate</li>
<li>Other factors</li>
<p>For some other networks, staking fees are paid as a fixed percentage. These rewards are distributed by the validator as a type of inflation compensation. Inflation encourages users to spend their coins instead of holding them, which may increase their use as cryptocurrencies. However, with this model, validators can calculate exactly what reward they can expect for a deposit.</p>
<p>A predictable reward schedule, rather than a probable chance of receiving a block reward, might be unfavorable for some. And since it is public information, it could motivate more participants to get involved in staking.</p>
<h2>What is cold staking?</h2>
<p>Cold staking refers to the process of depositing in wallets that are not connected to the Internet. This can be done with hardware wallets, but it is also possible with "air-gapped" software wallets.</p>
<p>Networks that support cold staking allow users to deposit while securely keeping their resources offline. It is worth noting that as soon as an interested party moves its coins from the cold wallet, it will stop receiving rewards.</p>
<p>Cold staking is especially useful for large stakeholders who want to ensure maximum protection of their funds while securing the network.</p>

<Excerpt>Staking can be considered a less demanding alternative to cryptocurrency mining. This includes holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet (or even on some exchange accounts) in order to support the security and operation of the blockchain network. Simply put, staking is the act of locking up cryptocurrencies for a reward.</Excerpt>

<Title>Bitcoin daily chart analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>The problem with the daily chart is the significant drop. At this point, several things can happen right away. I personally narrowed down all the options to the 3 most likely ones. Let's take a look at each of them.</p>
<h3>1. Similarity to COVID market drop</h3>
<p>This whole plunge had several similarities to the COVID one. If the same situation from last March were to repeat, it would look something like this. In essence, it would lead to a quick rise of Bitcoin again, followed by consolidation under the current top, and then another jump upwards once again.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_28_5_1_e975c4b708.JPG" alt="Bitcoin daily chart analysis">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Scenario number 1 - Similarity to COVID market drop</span>
<h3>2. Horizontal price movement</h3>
<p>The second option that is almost always valid is the horizontal price movement. After a big slump, there will be a longer consolidation and a mundane move to the side. This horizontal movement can be in the form of a triangle or in the form of a range. In essence, the price would go sideways for a while, and only then would the chart decide what to do next.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_28_5_2_03ee78b737.JPG" alt="Bitcoin horizontal price movement">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Scenario number 2 - Horizontal price movement</span>
<h3>3. ABC upward correction</h3>
<p>As a third and last option, I see the ABC correction, which would go to the resistance of <strong>$ 46,549 - 49,251</strong>
. However, the price would reach this price level also in the first scenario I have mentioned here. The only difference here is that in the first scenario we would stay at this level yet in this one, the price would bounce downwards, turning this price level into a resistance.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_28_5_3_ac31fb0ba0.JPG" alt="ABC horizontal upward correction">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Scenario number 3 -  ABC upward correction</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These are the three basic scenarios that we should be working with in the medium term. It is highly probable that one of these scenarios will be correct. But what would I recommend? Currently, it is best to focus on 4H and 1H charts. It is ideal to watch the nearest movement and make short few-hour trades.</p>
<p>I have presented a few charts and scenarios here. These will probably be valid for a few more weeks to come. However, from the trading point of view, we have to move to 4H charts because, at this point, we are unfortunately unable to read longer-term trades from this drop.</p>

<Excerpt>Another week has passed, another Bitcoin analysis is here, this time focused on the daily chart. We will talk about what is important and what we might expect in the hours and days to come.</Excerpt>

<Title>XPD/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.47%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.53%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.75%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.70%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>0.73%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>-2</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. Therefore, it is currently in the negative phase of the cycle. Indexation is currently in the last declining phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210529_cycles_dd1d756e06.jpg" alt="XPD/USD daily price indexation and cycles">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. The price of <strong>XPD/USD</strong>
 has weakened over the last month. Therefore, in the case of the monthly MA, it is in bearish sentiment after it has fallen below it in recent days. As we can see in the chart below, the <strong>6</strong>
 months and annual MAs still support bullish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210529_Mo_M_16145a7870.jpg" alt="XPD/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Over the last month, we have witnessed more declining trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>3</strong>
 consecutive days. However, the total maximum in the measured period (last <strong>3</strong>
 years) is <strong>5</strong>
 days. The upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. The maximum in the measured period is <strong>14</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.42%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.69%</strong>
, which is below this average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.0%</strong>
 and <strong>3.0%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210529_c_b3864852a5.jpg" alt="XPD/USD daily return distribution">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>5.25%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210528_lh_6a630400ce.jpg" alt="XPD/USD daily low to high distribution">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to positive sentiment since the beginning of this year, as the price creates higher highs and higher lows. <strong>XPD/USD</strong>
 is currently very close to the short-term moving average, which supported its price after falling in the last month. In addition, the divergence between the price development and the RSI could support this scenario. However, in the event of a further decline, there is the demand zone (green rectangle), where are also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 and the psychological level of <strong>2 700</strong>
 in the top of the zone.</p>

<Excerpt>The current price of XPD/USD - Palladium Spot US Dollar is 2 825.5 (May 28, 2021). This commodity has risen above all-time highs in the last month. We also wrote about a possible resistance of 3 000 that holds and the price has corrected down. Let’s now look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: An industry that poses a major challenge for regulators</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>The battle for regulation of the DeFi sector is being waged by the US SEC</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency sector also brings various risks to the market, which, in addition to investors, regulators also have to deal with. This was stated by the chairman of the American SEC, Gary Gensler, and he also pointed out the problem associated with the high volatility of this market. Tighter regulation would, in particular, protect investors and suggest that they provide protection against scams and market manipulation. At the same time, these are the same reasons that the SEC bases on rejecting Bitcoin exchange fund (ETF) applications.</p>
<span class="post-quote">"Crypto lending platforms and so-called decentralized finance (‘ DeFi ’) platforms raise a number of challenges for investors and the SEC staff trying to protect them."</span>
<span class="quote-author">Gary Gensler</span>
<p><strong>The total market cap of cryptocurrencies is attacking the $ 2 trillion</strong>
 threshold, after losing up to a third of its value recently after a bigger price drop. Bitcoin is also increasingly appearing in the mainstream media, with more than 80 cryptocurrencies on the market with a market cap of more than $ 1 billion and more than 1,500 cryptocurrencies with a market cap of over $ 1 million.</p>
<h2>DeFi representatives point to the fact that we are trying to regulate this industry through laws that are intended for a completely different world</h2>
<p>However, many lawyers of DeFi companies rightly ask why <strong>regulators are trying to apply the rules for centralized finance</strong>
 to a world where the only intermediaries are codes. It is relatively difficult for regulators to keep up with the innovations of the cryptocurrency world and therefore often try to make use of existing regulatory frameworks. Another problem is that there is practically no general interest in the uniform management of cryptocurrency regulations and especially in the DeFi sector.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/cryptocerrencies_regulations_complex_matter_39308f10ac.jpg" alt="Crypto regulations - Complex matter">
<span class="img-caption">Crypto regulations - Complex matter, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>In addition, <strong>decentralized finances exists in absolute contrast to the current financial system</strong>
, in which credible managers are needed to manage money. Of course, they do not exist in DeFi and <strong>everything is controlled only by pre-set (programmed) protocols.</strong>
 Many creators of these protocols even choose the path of the anonymous creator of Bitcoin, do the so-called "Satoshi move" and their platforms and protocols runs completely independently, without any administrator.</p>
<p>The <strong>current regulations are set to control intermediaries</strong>
 and their application to DeFi is completely impossible to the current extent. If there is no intermediary to hold your assets, trade on your behalf, or manage your personal information, there is no one you can prosecute in the event of a mistake or scam. This is where we get to the root of the matter. In the case of cryptocurrencies, <strong>everyone is the only administrator of their property and should therefore do also control</strong>
 over the entities to whom they entrust their funds.</p>
<p>The global crypto community is also coming into play here, trying to carry out this "supervision" for a long time and drawing attention to scammy projects almost constantly. DeFi could thus be a <strong>sector that regulates itself in some way through the market.</strong>
 According to experts, this could be a much better solution than trying to adapt regulatory frameworks, which are in principle intended for a diametrically different sector.</p>
<h2>Either the regulations change or the DeFi will move where it suits them better</h2>
<p>Leading lawyers of large DeFi companies have an extreme problem applying regulations to the protocols they represent. They often find themselves in a situation where they find that it is completely impossible. <strong>Regulations literally require them to forcefully insert an intermediary in the form of a code, or a human factor, into a fully decentralized process.</strong>
 Proponents of cryptocurrencies fight this process with all their can, but forced-centralization cannot be considered a suitable path to a safer DeFi sector.</p>
<p>As in any other industry, DeFi will certainly find individuals and companies whose interests cannot be considered pure. Regulators should therefore work with the crypto industry to jointly develop new regulatory frameworks that reap the benefits of a decentralized system. If this does not happen, <strong>development is likely to shift from the US to other jurisdictions</strong>
 that will suit DeFi companies. At the same time, the US would not get rid of this problem anyway, as DeFi protocols do not follow state borders and investors could continue to use them.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>The regulation of cryptocurrencies is a relatively complex matter. DeFi has no intermediaries, most of whose regulations are controlled. The SEC is proposing to return the role of intermediaries to decentralized systems. DeFi answers - let's work on investors protection together, if the laws don't change, we'll go elsewhere.</Excerpt>

<Title>Is Cardano about to "eat" the current financial system?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Despite the slump, ADA remains one of the leaders of the crypto market</h2>
<p>Cardano (ADA) has once again come to the forefront of the cryptocurrency world. This was caused by a report that talks about the introduction and availability of smart contracts on this platform. The total market cap of cryptocurrencies increased by 4.4% during Sunday and is currently around $ 1.6 trillion. The leader in this growth was <strong>Cardano, which gained more than 17% and its price is around $ 1.67.</strong>
 With a total market cap of more than $ 53 billion, it is the fourth largest cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Before the bustling of cryptocurrency markets on May 19, ADA was one of the best-performing assets up to $ 2.46, before it fell along with the rest of the market. However, even after this collapse, it seems that the mood of the supporters of this cryptocurrency remains positive and it is not for nothing that they are referred to as the most loyal community in the crypto space.</p>
<h2>The arrival of smart contracts is crucial information for Cardano</h2>
<p>The development part of the Cardano project is handled by Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK). They informed about a novelty in the form of the <strong>Alonzo smart contract, which will be gradually introduced to the testnet.</strong>
 The first users will be able to test it in the initial stage "Alonzo Blue", as an alpha testnet already during June. In this phase, cooperation begins with the Plutus project and other pioneers of Cardano smart contracts.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/cardano_ada_cryptocurrency_physical_coin_with_one_dollar_bill_f2b9008e40.jpg" alt="Cardano (ADA) cryptocurrency physical coin with one dollar bill">
<span class="img-caption">Cardano (ADA) cryptocurrency physical coin with one dollar bill, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<span class="post-quote">"The Alonzo hard fork will bring exciting and highly-anticipated new capabilities to Cardano through the integration of Plutus scripts onto the blockchain. These will allow for the implementation of smart contracts in Cardano, enabling the deployment of a wide range of new DeFi applications for the first time."</span>
<span class="quote-author">Input Output Hong Kong about Alonzo smart contract</span>
<p>Alpha partners have been selected to bring the Cardano network the <strong>widest possible range of different tools - decentralized exchanges, lending and borrowing, stablecoins, NFT and DeFi tools.</strong>
 The main goal of the Blue phase is to detect and correct any deficiencies so that the most stable code can be created. In the next phases, White and Purple, the expansion of the group of testers is expected, and Purple should be the version almost ready for the <strong>public launch, which is expected in August</strong>
 this year.</p>
<h2>The founder of Cardano claims that the current financial system and central banks are outdated and will be absorbed by cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson, also shared his thoughts. He claims that <strong>cryptocurrencies will take control as they simply offer a better way.</strong>
 Of course, he also warmed soup for his project, adding that Cardano will be one of the cryptocurrencies that will destroy the current financial system also thanks to the support of the smart contracts. To a large extent, he also openly criticizes the banks and says that they got into this situation through their own fault.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/charles_hoskinson_cardano_ada_founder_3e337036d4.jpg" alt="default">
<span class="img-caption">Charles Hoskinson Cardano (ADA) Founder, Source: coinmarketcap.com</span>
<span class="post-quote">"It wasn’t us who charged 15% to some of the poorest people in the world to move their money home to take care of their parents. It was the people who ran the old system. It wasn't us, in this industry, who charge 85% interest to lend $ 100 to a subsistence farmer, desperately trying to survive after a drought."</span>
<span class="quote-author">Charles Hoskinson, Cardano Founder</span>
<p>He also highlights the <strong>mistakes of the banking system, such as nepotism and the pursuit for profits at all costs.</strong>
 He despises their complicity in money laundering, for example from drugs or oil, and sees cryptocurrencies as the only cure for this situation.</p>
<span class="post-quote">"Never allow them to say ours is the industry that’s the risk. Ours is the industry that’s the antidote to the excesses, corruption, and nepotism that we’ve found. This is an industry of frustration that has now been replaced by an industry of creativity and innovation. We're going to change the world."</span>
<span class="quote-author">Charles Hoskinson, Cardano Founder</span>
<p>The banking sector has a huge advantage over cryptocurrencies in terms of total capitalization and the number of users. However, Hoskinson believes that this is only a temporary situation that will change soon. According to him, <strong>cryptocurrencies are a genie that can no longer be returned to the bottle, and therefore central and commercial banks must gradually disappear.</strong>
</p>

<Excerpt>Supporters of the cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA) have reasons to celebrate again. The company has announced the testing of smart contracts, which will turn it beyond recognition and bring huge opportunities for further development. Founder Charles Hoskinson also commented about what cryptocurrencies can do to the current financial system.</Excerpt>

<Title>Investro Tea: Week #22</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Computer chips shortage</h2>
<p>There has been a shortage of computer chips on the market for a long time. Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) management has released a report, where they state that the shortage could affect some of the company's orders planned for this year. This, of course, was subsequently reflected in the fall in the company’s share price.</p>
<p>The Japanese government has therefore decided to invest in the development of new production technologies, investing up to $ 330 million in twenty Japanese companies. One of the largest producers originating in Taiwan, TSMC (Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company), will also be involved in the project. You can find more information about this investment <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-s-Japan-project-attracts-over-20-participant-companies">here</a>

<h2>Chinese space program</h2>
<p>For our second news today, we will be talking about Asia again. Last week at Investro Tea, we looked at USA-based space flights. This time we can look at China's success. China's Tchien-che (Heavenly Harmony) space station project is continuing successfully and as of the last Sunday, another module joined the station without any major issues. The station is expected to be fully operational in 2022, which means that the ISS space station will soon have competition in orbit.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>At the end of today's tea, let's take a brief look at the world of cryptocurrencies. As you <a href="https://investro.com/crypto/is-cardano-about-to-eat-the-current-financial-system">can read in our article</a>
  - Cardano is doing quite well.</p>
<p>Iran, on the other hand, is appalled by cryptocurrencies and their energy consumption and has therefore banned mining altogether. As much as 4.5% of the global Bitcoin volume was mined in Iran. So it is a big blow for the local miners. However, the ban is temporary and will last only a few months, until the energetic network can be improved and blackouts can be prevented. You can learn more in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-57260829">this article</a>
.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to profit, the crypto investor is not limited only to mining. Have you heard about staking? If not, then be sure to check<a href="https://investro.com/crypto/fundament-of-the-week-what-is-staking"> this article</a>

<Title>AUD/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.54%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.58%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.28%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.27%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was <strong>0.43%</strong>
, which is still below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently negative (<strong>-1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-3</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the last negative phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to all MAs, <strong>AUD/USD</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment, after falling below it last week. As we can see in the chart below, the 6 months and annual MAs are still in bullish sentiment. In the event of a decline, the 6-month MA can be an important support for the exchange rate.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, there have been more upward trends. Last summer reached a maximum of <strong>7</strong>
 consecutive days. Downward trends did not also exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. However, the maximum in the measured period is <strong>11</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.03%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.54%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.2%</strong>
 and <strong>1.2%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.75%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports longer-term bullish sentiment, as the exchange rate creates higher highs and higher lows. This pair traded sideways with the support of a short-term moving average and a psychological level of <strong>0.7700</strong>
. However, we can also clearly see a bullish divergence between the market price and the RSI. <strong>AUD/USD</strong>
 volumes were also above average in mid-May. In the event of a decline, the longer-term moving average and the psychological level of <strong>0.7600</strong>
 could be a strong support for bulls.</p>

<Title>Fundament of the week: Cryptocurrency delisting</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The reasons, which contribute to traditional delisting, include, for example, bankruptcy, project termination, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and non-compliance with listing requirements. Although the factors supporting the removal of cryptocurrencies are conceptually different from the factors supporting the removal of shares, several similarities can be found.</p>
<h3>What is cryptocurrency delisting?</h3>
<p>Delisting refers to the removal of a cryptocurrency (coin or token) or trading pair (eg LTC / XMR) from trading. Deletion can also take place voluntarily for various reasons at the request of a cryptocurrency project lead. Alternatively, a more common reason for (involuntary) exclusion is that the cryptocurrency no longer meets the various listing requirements set by the exchange.</p>
<h2>Criteria for delisting</h2>
<p>There are several factors that can lead to the cryptocurrency delisting</p>
<p><strong>Regulatory uncertainty</strong>
</p>
<p>In pursuit of the long-term functioning of the cryptocurrency exchange, especially those based in the United States, crypto exchanges take on the responsibility of self-regulation by ensuring that their activities are strictly governed by general guidelines or by any legal form indicated by regulators. For example, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has published a set of guidelines that define cryptocurrencies. It clarified the definition of cryptocurrencies by taking over the capacity of a security, currency, or commodity. For this reason, cryptocurrency exchanges established and licensed in the United States are required to comply internally with these guidelines by ensuring that no cryptocurrency security is listed on their platform. This allegedly prevents the regulatory measures in the securities field from taking place. SEC guidelines are not legally binding or enforceable. However, we know from experience that security cryptocurrencies, such as Monero and Zcash, are also traded on these exchanges.</p>
<p><strong>Low volume and liquidity</strong>
</p>
<p>The main activity of the cryptocurrency exchange is the acquisition of trading and other fees, such as those for withdrawal. Whenever a user buys or sells a cryptocurrency on the crypto exchange, a fee is charged. In the daily execution of millions of trades, there is a strong incentive for stock exchanges to support high-volume cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency with a high trading volume is a cryptocurrency with a high level of liquidity, this means that it is a very sought-after coin when it comes to traders. Cryptocurrencies with declining volumes and low liquidity are losing attractiveness among users, slowly paving their way towards exclusion from trading. Supporting cryptocurrency on the crypto exchange requires economic resources that the exchange must use, and if the coin has low liquidity, it makes no sense for the exchange to continue to support it.</p>
<p><strong>Failure to comply with dimensioning requirements</strong>
</p>
<p>Placing any cryptocurrency on the market means a set of requirements that a project must meet. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in the cessation of the cryptocurrency. The main factors in deciding on delisting from the stock exchange include:</p>
<li>General team commitment of the project</li>
<li>Activity, quality, and level of development</li>
<li>Network stability and security</li>
<li>Degree of external communication of the team</li>
<li>Response to a request for due diligence in trading</li>
<li>Fraud or unethical activity</li>
<p>There are many other factors in the crypto exchanges themselves. Given that trade in cryptocurrencies is geared towards compliance with legislation, active and effective enforcement of their criteria is an indispensable part of ensuring the long-term viability of their business. Trading cryptocurrencies that are in conflict with the requirements and principles of the exchange could pose a legal risk.</p>
<p><strong>Security breach</strong>
</p>
<p>Security is the highest aspect of any project, given the digital nature of operations. Especially in this budding phase of blockchain technology. Not surprisingly, major technical and security weaknesses lead to the delisting of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>As soon as internal cryptocurrency developers discover a security vulnerability or technical ambiguity in the cryptocurrency network (e.g., 51% attack), measures must be taken to protect the cryptocurrency holders. This requires a constant exchange of information between project team members, and if developers' reactions are insufficient, delisting is likely. This happened, for example, when Bittrex stopped offering BTG after a 51% attack on its network.</p>
<h2>Consequences of delisting</h2>
<p>Any removal of the cryptocurrency from trading could have devastating consequences:</p>
<p><strong>Depreciation of prices</strong>
</p>
<p>The most visible effect is a sharp drop in prices at the time of notification. Normally, the first announcement will be made to eliminate several cryptocurrencies that are currently actively traded on the crypto exchange. The exchange will give coin holders two to three weeks to prepare for delisting. Thereafter, the cryptocurrency is permanently removed from the exchange without further support from its side.</p>
<p><strong>Reduced liquidity and trading volume</strong>
</p>
<p>The liquidity of a coin depends on its traded volume. Low liquidity coins have low trading activity and few buy and sell orders. The liquidity of a cryptocurrency can also be affected by the number of exchanges that have it on offer. If a cryptocurrency is traded on several crypto exchanges, the volume of trading is greater and its liquidity also increases.</p>
<p><strong>Loss of credibility</strong>
</p>
<p>The main consequence of delisting is the general loss of public credibility with the whole project. In general, it is likely that cryptocurrencies will be delisted from trading as soon as serious and fundamental shortcomings or adverse project changes occur which could then lead to long-term sustainability issues.</p>

<Excerpt>Just as some of the shares in traditional financial markets are occasionally withdrawn from the stock exchange for various reasons, are cryptocurrencies withdrawn in a similar way. Today, we will look at some of those scenarios.</Excerpt>

<Title>AMC – the MEME opportunity once again</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The goal was to bring the action to the highest possible level and then sell. It should not be forgotten that they have also tried to shoot GME and AMC in the past. In part, they succeeded. Subsequently, GME, AMC, KOSS, BB, and other stocks, after record and rapid growth, deducted tens of percent (some up to -80%).</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the short squeeze took place through yesterday and the Gamma squeeze. However, this massive, fundamentally unwarranted growth reaches a significant extreme, to speak of our analytical view.
Please note in advance that this is under no circumstances an investment recommendation. Still, this article only expresses our analytical perspective and serves a purely analytical and informational purpose.</p>
<h2>Let's take it to step by step</h2>
<p>AMC has been reaching extremes worthy of a short position for a few days now. Please note in advance that this is too great a risk and therefore, under no circumstances do we recommend opening significantly short positions. What point could be extreme if we cannot determine the top or compare it with history? In our opinion, the top could be found if we look at the event from the perspective of market capitalization. At the same time, we will look at the top during the winter of 2021 at GME events. We can expect the top to be reached similar levels or slightly higher. The chart below shows GME (blue) and AMC (orange) and comparable data on market capitalization. We can confirm that AMC's market capitalization exceeded GME in January. This is logical, as greed is getting more significant on the market. From this point of view, we would believe that this may be the peak. Even if we cannot guarantee it in any way, it is only our assumption.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/amc_gme_3d0e41f814.png" alt="AMC and GME market CAP">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Tradingview</span>
<p>A perfect solution would be if AMC used this speculative growth for issuance, resp. Sale of shares to obtain the highest possible amount of money. They did so according to our assumption. Thus, the market will partially pay the company's "operating costs" and managers' fees and use the high liquidity to its advantage. We are not even surprised, from their point of view, we would probably do the same, for the good of the company.</p>
<p>According to the full <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001411579/000110465921076091/tm2118373d2_8k.htm">8-K</a>
:
"*On June 3, 2021, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (the "Company") entered into an equity distribution agreement (the "Equity Distribution Agreement") with B. Riley Securities, Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as sales agents (each, a "Sales Agent" and collectively, the "Sales Agents"), to sell up to 11,550,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the "Common Stock"), from time to time, through an "at-the-market" offering program (the "Offering"). *"</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/amc_zh_cbcba20fe3.jpg" alt="AMC stock offering">
<span class="img-caption">Source: ZH</span>
<p>However, a very funny moment is that the Company second time raised the capital by selling shares. In the above graph, we can see the sequence. At 99%, such reports represent a very negative situation for investors, and stocks are going down. This is still happening today, but it is questionable how they will develop tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. In our opinion, there was not much room for growth, as AMC reached more than $ 33 billion (which was the maximum) in terms of market cap. However, it is fundamentally entirely out of these valuations. The short-term momentum is still powerful, but it is likely that if stocks continue to rise sharply, management can try and take a similar step. From this point of view, it is much riskier to be in a long position than in a short one. Of course, poorly managed risk management would probably lead to losses on both sides...</p>
<h2>Our analytical point of view</h2>
<p>A solid solution would be to open put spreads on options, as there is limited risk. However, it must be said that they do not currently pay off at all because the values of all options, mainly OTM and ATM, but also ITM, are significantly high. From this point of view, one might say that "go short call." We do not recommend this under any circumstances, even if it is an attractive solution. In this way, several funds were detonated because the risk was not covered, respectively, was unlimited, and especially at these meme events, we don't know where the top will be. However, we assume that we will see a significant price drop within about 0-4 weeks. Probably the best and safest alternative would be to think about diagonal put spreads.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Technical Analysis of Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>On the daily chart, we basically have 2 options. In terms of probability, it is about 55% for decline and 45% for growth. As for the triangle formation, it is more probable that the triangle will follow a movement in a given direction. This means that since the last direction was downwards, there is a slightly greater chance of a downward direction. However, I personally have experienced that after a triangle formation had been formed on Bitcoin’s absolute bottom, the price went up nevertheless. Needless to say, it was a bitter experience.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_4_6_1_7d7e3f117c.JPG" alt="Bitcoin technical analysis on a daily chart">
<span class="img-caption">Chart 1: Technical analysis of the Bitcoin on a daily chart</span>
<h2>4H chart</h2>
<p>On the 4H chart, we see a perfectly symmetric triangle. Yesterday there was a strong promise of a downward breakdown at night, however, 3 key events happened. It was precisely these events that led to the rejection in the market.</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong>
 Bitcoin could not break through the mentioned triangle formation on all crypto exchanges. On some of them, everything was pointing towards a breakout, but overall we cannot say that this was the case on all of them.</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong>
 That night, classic markets also fell, probably due to the dollar index. S&P500, Nasdaq, Gold, and Silver market also fell.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong>
 And the last straw was a tweet by none other than E. Musk who expressed his negative stance towards Bitcoin once again.
However, I dare say that Elon's tweet has only accelerated the decline, but it was not the cause of it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is experiencing harder times. While a few weeks ago the price has already been attacking 65,000 USD, today it is a whole other story with price level oscillating around 35 000 USD. Of course, many newcomers bought at higher prices and therefore are currently at a loss. The coming days and weeks will be crucial for Bitcoin, but I do not think this bull-run is over.</p>

<Title>XPT/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.03%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.07%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.53%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.50%</strong>
. Friday´s return was only <strong>0.43%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>2</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. Indexation is currently in the initial positive phase of the cycle. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210605_Mo_M_2163d23549.jpg" alt="XPT/USD daily price indexation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. In the case of monthly MA, <strong>XPT/USD</strong>
 is clearly in bearish sentiment. The 6 months MA could be support for the price. The annual MA still supports bullish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210605_cycles_e2d19355c4.jpg" alt="XPT/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>In recent weeks, we have witnessed more declining trends that did not exceed <strong>5</strong>
 days. The total maximum in the measured period (last <strong>3</strong>
 years) is <strong>7</strong>
 days. Upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. The total maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>6</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.53%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>3.31%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-2.40%</strong>
 and <strong>2.40%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>3.60%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210605_lh_3873707e9e.jpg" alt="XPT/USD daily low to high distribution">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports long-term bullish sentiment as the commodity price creates higher highs and higher lows. The short-term outlook is more negative. <strong>XPT/USD</strong>
 is currently very close to the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
. This could be strong support for the price. However, we must see a movement above the short-term moving average and the psychological level of <strong>1 200</strong>
. In the event of a further decline, there is the demand zone (green rectangle) with the psychological level of <strong>1 100</strong>
. This scenario could also support the divergence between price development and the RSI, which was created from April to May.</p>

<Excerpt>The current price of XPT/USD – Platinum Spot US Dollar is 1 162.00 (Jun 04, 2021). This commodity is mostly traded sideways this year. Dynamic movement could indicate further developments. Let us therefore look now at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: DeFi must focus on improving privacy</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>DeFi is considered to be one of the best use-cases for blockchain</h2>
<p>Just about a month and a half ago, MakerDAO, in collaboration with the Centrifuge project, managed to make its <strong>first real-world loan on DeFi.</strong>
 MakerDAO is often referred to as a kind of central bank of the DeFi world, and this fact only confirms it. This is an important milestone in decentralized finances, which may represent an important breakthrough in the financial world as we know it.</p>
<p>The financial institutions of the future will be able to provide their services 24 hours a day and smart contracts will guarantee that the issue of trust in the institution and its practices will no longer be on the table. Among other things, it will also bring low-interest loans and access to immediate liquidity with minimal capital costs. DeFi thus opens the door to a <strong>new trillion market</strong>
 and various companies will certainly not want to miss this opportunity.</p>
<h2>Financial institutions are guarding their privacy and will certainly not compromise on this</h2>
<p>DeFi is gradually gaining the attention of even the largest financial institutions. Only recently has Bank of America published a report suggesting that, given the existence of DeFi, they predict a <strong>more optimistic future for Ethereum than Bitcoin.</strong>
 However, decentralized finances are not yet fully prepared to take on the tasks of traditional finances. For example, for Ethereum, the biggest problems at the moment are high transaction fees, the efficiency of transaction processing and, in particular, the lack of protection of users' privacy.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/defi_privacy_as_a_key_to_success_d3f180395d.jpg" alt="DeFi: Privacy as a key to success">
<span class="img-caption">DeFi: Privacy as a key to success, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>Traditional investors, banks and various institutions attach great importance to the protection of their privacy. It is very unlikely that they would allocate all their finances to a fully open platform where everyone can see them. This <strong>allows everybody to accurately monitor users' financial behaviour</strong>
 and even predict their next steps.</p>
<p>In addition, the open platforms provide <strong>sensitive financial information that can be misused by various attackers.</strong>
 Thus, we cannot assume that investors would voluntarily take a similar risk. Protecting transactions information will reduce the risk of attacks or arbitrage.</p>
<h2>The DeFi sector needs to make significant efforts to improve privacy</h2>
<p>Only by improving the current state of protection of private and sensitive information can DeFi open the doors to a broad financial market in the real world. Of course, <strong>various solutions already exist</strong>
 and intensive work is being done on the development of others. For example, the cryptocurrency <strong>ZCash</strong>
 is aiming at protecting privacy, as well as the services of so-called cryptocurrency mixers - for example, <strong>Tornado Cash, MixerTombler and Onion Mixer.</strong>
</p>
<p>Although these services provide a higher level of privacy protection, they also have problems to deal with. The main thing is that <strong>privacy protection almost completely eliminates the support of smart contracts</strong>
, which are absolutely necessary for the operation of DeFi.</p>
<p>Traditional finances have various safeguards - such as futures, options and swaps. In their activities, they certainly do not want anyone on the chain to monitor their investment procedures. This could give their competitors a huge advantage. DeFi is clearly a unique industry, but it must continue to develop and modernize, especially in the area of privacy. However, we are not at all worried that the necessary solutions will not be developed in the end, so <strong>we can all look forward to much better financial services.</strong>
</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>The DeFi industry certainly boasts a literal rocket launch and development that other industries can hardly compete with. However, this does not mean that there are no challenges for the developers. One of the biggest obstacles to the inflow of institutional capital is the protection of privacy on a fully open platform.</Excerpt>

<Title>Message from hactivist group Anonymous for Elon Musk: "Expect us."</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Let's watch the video first:</h2>
<p>This almost 4-minute video, released on June 5, now has more than 2 million views. The hacker group Anonymous is most likely behind it - the video bears all the hallmarks of past videos, which are generally accepted as their "brand".</p>
<p>The narrator in the video in the mask uses a voice changer and accuses Musk of many of different things. He points out that <strong>he is not, in fact, a visionary with good intentions, but rather a narcissistic rich man</strong>
 who cares only about himself. Through its reach and popularity on the social network Twitter, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX allegedly deliberately influence crypto markets and <strong>"destroyed lives" of many hard-working people.</strong>
 It is important to say that he is far from being blamed only by Anonymous.</p>
<h2>Why are Elon Musk's views on cryptocurrencies so inconsistent?</h2>
<p>It is generally believed that Musk was literally forced to declare that Tesla did not support Bitcoin so much. The reason was simple - <strong>Tesla takes huge "green money" subsidies from the state,</strong>
 which they cannot afford to lose.</p>
<span class="post-quote">"It is now widely believed you have been forced to denounce your company involvement with bitcoin in order to keep that green government money flowing into Tesla's coffers,"</span>
<span class="quote-author">Anonymous</span>
<p>The video also talks about the amount of money that was literally wiped from crypto markets due to Musk's tweets.</p>
<span class="post-quote">“Millions of retail investors were really counting on their crypto gains to improve their lives. ... As hardworking people have their dreams liquidated over your public temper tantrums, you continue to mock them with memes from one of your million-dollar mansions."</span>
<span class="quote-author">Anonymous</span>
<h2>Elon Musk's reasons for such actions may be completely different</h2>
<p>At times, Tesla's CEO seems interested in cryptocurrencies but doesn't want to understand them in depth. A decentralized system needs some form of security, and for Bitcoin, it is <strong>Proof-of-Work (PoW) security.</strong>
 This means that the more successful Bitcoin is, the more energy it consumes to be secured. It consumes much more energy than, for example, Dogecoin (DOGE), but the reason is that it is much safer.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/elon_musk_ceo_tesla_8e15be462f.jpg" alt="Elon Musk, CEO Tesla">
<span class="img-caption">Elon Musk, CEO Tesla, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>Elon Musk's irony, hidden behind his interest in green energy, is even more fun. <strong>Energy does not know where it comes from.</strong>
 Have you ever asked someone where the energy that drives their washing machine comes from? No. The reason is that energy is not responsible for how we produced it. We can only blame ourselves and the methods we are using to produce energy. Any improvements that will contribute to a greener planet (which we all probably want) should go to production.</p>
<p>But why did Musk choose Dogecoin, which really has no real value behind it? The reason can be quite simple. <strong>Elon Musk likes being famous,</strong>
 which includes a certain level of "power". At one point, he probably realized that <strong>Bitcoin is too big to be easily influenced, so he chose a much "simpler target" - Dogecoin.</strong>
 It is a cryptocurrency, which originated as a joke and its creators literally evaporated at a certain moment, while they did not seem to be interested in their creation in any extra way. This was what Musk could see as an opportunity to take control. He, therefore, fit in the role of Dogecoin boss and it's up to everyone to judge whether you want to invest in something like that.</p>
<h2>Back to the video: Anonymous added a clear message at the end of the video</h2>
<p>The last part of the video says that Elon is not the only one involved in the development of electric vehicles and space exploration. The narrator warns him that the competition is growing every day and he is only CEO of one company, which has gained popularity through sh*tposting and trolling on social networks.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Anonymous Vendetta mask with smoke, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<span class="post-quote">„You may think you are the smartest person in the room, but now you have met your match. We are Anonymous! We are Legion! Expect us."</span>
<span class="quote-author">Anonymous</span>
<p>Many people shared the video under Musk's posts on Twitter. We haven't received a direct response yet, but Musk has posted a tweet that many consider a response.</p>
<span class="post-quote">“Don't kill what you hate. Save what you love."</span>
<span class="quote-author">Elon Musk</span>

<Excerpt>Well-known Elon Musk received a message from the group Anonymous, which probably did not please him very much. In the video, they reveal the dark sides of his life and add a clear message at the end.</Excerpt>

<Title>Investro Tea: Week #23</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>As we have already mentioned, US President Joe Biden has announced an extensive strategy to secure supply chains not only in the area of computer chips, where there is a great shortage, but also in medicine and drug delivery.</p>
<p>The main goal of the strategy is to return suppliers to US soil so that they are not so dependent on international supplies. You can <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/biden-unveils-supply-chain-plan-to-boost-medicine-chip-output">learn more in this article</a>
.</p>
<h2>G7 and taxation of multinational companies</h2>
<p>Two weeks ago, we informed you that at its meeting, the G7 was debating the recommendation of a single tax for large corporations so that they could not easily flee to tax havens. The leaders of all seven countries agreed that the single tax should be 15%. With Joe Biden's administration also agreeing on this, it is quite possible that the implementation process for the 15% global minimum corporate tax rate might begin in the near future. You can read more about it, for example, in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/g-7-nations-agree-on-new-rules-for-taxing-global-companies-11622893415">Wall Street Journal</a>
.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>After great growth and subsequent fall, cryptocurrencies are still looking for a new level. At this point, Bitcoin alone fluctuates between 30 000 - 40 000 dollars and it seems that it will remain so in the weeks to come. We will see if it eventually returns to its last year's value, which was below $ 30,000.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin Price, Source: Coinmarketcap.com</span>
<p>After a long time, the Anonymous movement has come to light again, and this time their target is Elon Musk, who, according to them, abuses his influence too much harming a large number of people in the process. You can read what Anonymous plans for Elon Musk <a href="https://investro.com/crypto/message-from-hactivist-group-anonymous-for-elon-musk-expect-us">in our article</a>
.</p>
<p>And speaking of Elon, the world's wealthiest man and owner of Tesla company have decided to cancel the development of a new version of his Tesla S Plaid car model. See his own Twitter:</p>

<Title>NZD/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.58%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.60%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.30%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.28%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was <strong>0.47%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently negative (<strong>-1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-2</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the negative phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>

<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to the monthly MA, <strong>NZD/USD</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment, after falling below it last week. As we can see in the chart below, the 6 months and annual MAs are still in bullish sentiment. In the event of a decline, the 6-month MA can be an important support for the exchange rate. This has already happened this year.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the beginning of <strong>2021</strong>
, there have been more upward trends, with a maximum of <strong>4</strong>
 consecutive days. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. The maximum in the measured period is <strong>8</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.01%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.72%</strong>
. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.2%</strong>
 and <strong>1.2%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>Basic technical analysis still supports longer-term bullish sentiment, as the exchange rate creates higher highs and higher lows. This pair has been in the stabilization phase since our last analysis. The short-term moving average acts as a strong support. However, we can clearly see the bearish divergence between the market price and the RSI, which pushes the pair down. <strong>NZD/USD</strong>
 is currently also close to an important psychological level of <strong>0.7200</strong>
. In the event of a further decline, the psychological level of <strong>0.7000</strong>
, the long-term moving average and the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 could be a strong support for bulls.</p>

<Title>Fundament of the Week: IOTA and Tangle technology</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What is IOTA?</h2>
<p>IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger that aims to facilitate secure payments and communication between IoT devices (<a href="https://investro.com/crypto/the-fundament-of-the-week-internet-of-things-io-t">read our article about the Internet of Things concept</a>
).</p>
<p>Instead of using blockchain technology, as in the case of Bitcoin, IOTA uses a streamlined acyclic chart and also allows users to trade at no charge, unlike other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Confirmation and transaction times are faster than on a blockchain, and the number of individual transactions that the system can process at once is unlimited. This is a clear advantage over the often slow blockchain. IOTA was founded in 2015 by David Sønstebø, Dominik Schiener, Dr. Sergei Popov and Sergei Ivanchek.</p>
<h2>What is IOTA Tangle?</h2>
<p>Iota Tangle is the name of the platform or system on which IOTA operates. Instead of using a blockchain, as is the case with other cryptocurrencies, it is replaced by a different concept, which in this case is colloquially referred to as "Tangle".</p>
<p>It is mostly a generalization of the established blockchain protocol known as the DAG type. IOTA Tangle uses the Winternitz signature, which is hash-based cryptography that is used instead of ordinary elliptic curve cryptography or ECC. These hashing algorithm-based signatures provide much faster processing than ECC (elliptic curve) cryptography signatures.</p>
<p>In mid-2017, a security issue has appeared in the IOTA hash function known as Curl. It has been found that signatures can be easily forged, but developers have quickly replaced the hash function with Kerl (SHA-3 version). The new hash function works with three variables as opposed to binary operations. This makes IOTA and Tangle much safer.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/Tangle_d4652df15d.png" alt="Tangle protocol">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Tangle Protocol scheme</span>
<h2>How does Tangle work?</h2>
<p>Here is how Tangle works from several basic aspects.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong>
</p>
<p>Because the Tangle protocol is set up and implemented, its scalability is almost infinite. Unlike blockchain-based networks, which slow down as more users are added, Tangle actually becomes much faster. This is because the growing number of users leads to faster validation time. The lower hash power required for transactions over the Tangle network is also another incentive to use Tangle for new users.</p>
<p><strong>Blockless</strong>
</p>
<p>Tangle does not use blocks and does not require the sequence values of the addresses to be maintained in the correct order. This means that all transactions can be stored on multiple different devices, at different locations, in different orders, and even split and mixed.</p>
<p>If you synchronize your node, the system simply repeats all existing transactions and groups them into their addresses, regardless of order. Once Tangle has processed all transactions, the book and addresses will display all balances, and all the user has to do is verify that there are no unfavorable balances between the addresses.</p>
<p>This excellent feature is ideal for use in cases where there are a large number of interconnected devices.</p>
<p><strong>Multi transaction</strong>
</p>
<p>They are defined as a large number of transactions that are in a chain but use the same address. In addition, these chains are designed so that only the first transaction has a value, while subsequent transactions are assigned a value of zero. This results in a situation where no "regulation" is required and no transactions are skipped. So, as a result, there are no transaction fees in Tangle which makes it possible to perform micro and nano transactions.</p>
<p><strong>JINN processors</strong>
</p>
<p>As already mentioned, Tangle works with "ternary" JINN processors, unlike typical and more widespread binary processors.</p>
<p>These are general-purpose processors that have the power and ability to process thousands and thousands of transactions per second. This is partly due to the fact that, unlike binary processors, they can circulate around 0, leading to a balanced transaction that helps build a self-sufficient network.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/tangle_VS_Blockchain_d661cc1ba4.png" alt="Tangle versus Blockchain ">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Tangle versus Blockchain</span>
<p><strong>Quantum resistance</strong>
</p>
<p>Unlike other blockchain-based networks, Tangle is quantum resistant. With the development of technology, it is likely that systems that are to be considered safe may in fact be quantum computers. Due to the astronomical computing power offered by quantum computers, some blockchain-based technologies may be vulnerable to attack in the future. Tangle uses one-time Winternitz signatures, so for now it can be argued that the Tangle protocol is quantum resistant.</p>
<p><strong>Masked authenticated messages (MAM)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Tangle protocol also allows nodes to exchange authenticated and encrypted data with each other. The quantum-resistant nature of the Tangle protocol ensures that data sent from its network are also resistant to any quantum computer attacks. MAM also allows you to share data with specific parties.</p>
<p><strong>Data transfer</strong>
</p>
<p>Another key feature of the Tangle protocol is network data transmission. IOTA allows users to establish communication channels between devices. The data sent via these communication channels are fully authenticated and protected against unauthorized access.</p>

<Title>CPI rose to 5% in May - What to expect</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>However, it should not be forgotten that this is also due to the fact that in 2020 CPI growth was much smaller than it is now.  This is the largest growth in CPI since August 2008. Month-on-month growth is also very interesting.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/cpi_f70510421f.jpg" alt="CPI">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Bloomberg</span>
<p>A very interesting year-on-year growth shows core inflation, which is cleaned of food and energy. Here we can monitor the largest growth since 1992. Of course, in these years, the main rates (Fed funds) were much higher, at about 20%. In this case, the situation cannot be compared.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/core_cpi_5146fdef66.jpg" alt="Core CPI">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Zerohedge via Bloomberg</span>
<p>If we want to look at what makes this growth the largest, below we provide a table of data. We can also confirm from this data that fiscal and monetary stimulus has had the most impact on energy and commodity prices. Transport services and used cars and trucks have also increased significantly. We are likely to see such increased numbers throughout 2021, but from this point of view there are already signals from the Fed, the so-called "rumors" about tapering - that is, a reduction in the amount of asset purchases.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Technical Analysis of Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>How did the above-mentioned movements affect the daily chart? To be honest, they did not.</p>
<p>The support is still at $ 28,841 - $ 30,364. Strong resistance on the daily chart is $ 46,423 - $ 49,036. This resistance will probably be the biggest obstacle in reaching the new ATH. So far, we can see that no significant growth has come from LOW, and we can basically say that we are still quite low. However, as long as we keep the same support, it is all right. Bitcoin has experienced very rapid growth in recent months. And the same adjective can be used when describing the decline which happened in recent weeks. From this point of view, I would not be surprised if a period of boredom or a movement in a certain price range would follow. We have strong support from the bottom with resistance pushing us from above. At this point, Bitcoin is locked and will remain that way for a while.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Technical analysis of BTC on a daily chart </span>
<h2>4H chart</h2>
<p>As for the 4H chart, I personally expect a breakout from resistance. The only thing left to solve is from what value will that happen. For technical analysis’s sake, it would be ideal if the price would go to test the level of $ 34,778 - 35,475. However, as can be seen in the chart, the MA77 still holds. The longer we are under this trend, the greater the chance of a break.
Of course, there is a possibility of decline, but I personally am rooting for the price to grow. One of the main arguments for me is the volumes that are being currently traded.</p>
<p>When we look at the volumes at which we have been declining and compare them to the ones at which we were growing, it is clear where the predominance is. The fall from the triangle was absolutely volume-free, which is why Bitcoin managed to recover so quickly. Now the volumes are insignificant again so we will wait for the next move. However, my opinion is that it should an upward one.</p>

<Title>XAG/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.30%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.37%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.68%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.62%</strong>
. Friday´s return was only <strong>-0.27%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and slightly negative <strong>-1</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. Indexing is currently testing the lows of this year. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>There were a more downward trends in the first quarter of this year. The following months, however, represented more upward trends that have not exceeded more than <strong>3</strong>
 consecutive days. The declining trends did not exceed more than <strong>2</strong>
 days in the same period. The total maximum for the last <strong>3</strong>
 years is <strong>6</strong>
 days for the uptrend and <strong>-8</strong>
 days for the downtrend. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.64%</strong>

<p>Basic technical analysis points to neutral sentiment in recent weeks.<strong>XAG/USD</strong>
 is currently very close to the psychological level of <strong>28.00</strong>
. The divergence between price development and the RSI could motive short-term bulls. However, there could be strong resistance at <strong>30.00</strong>
 to move further north. In the event of a further decline, the demand zone (green rectangle), where there are also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>

<Excerpt>The current price of XAG/USD - Silver Spot US Dollar is 27.890 (June 11, 2021). This commodity has been traded mostly sideways for the past month. The price has been in a slightly positive development since our last analysis. Let us therefore look again at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<p>According to Ledger statistics, they are not doing badly at all. They say they have <strong>sold more than 3 million hardware wallets in 190 countries</strong>
 around the world. In addition, they register more than 1.5 active users of the Ledger Live application each month. These numbers show that <strong>up to 15% of all crypto assets are globally protected through their hardware.</strong>
</p>
<p>This round of fundraising was the third in a row and the amount raised grows with each round. In the first round (Series A) they received $ 8.3 million and in the second (Series B) in 2018 up to $ 75 million. Last round - Series C brought them $ 380 million. <strong>The company was valued at up to $ 1.5 billion</strong>
 in this round.</p>
<h2>The French manufacturer has ambitious plans in DeFi</h2>
<p>As much as $ 380 million raised in the last round of Series C fundraising is planned to be used primarily <strong>to improve access to decentralized finances</strong>
 and significantly expand the company's capacities. Ledger is really serious about plans with DeFi and they are going to invest in the further development of their own operating system, which should subsequently support the integration of third-party solutions. The hardware wallet itself as well as the Ledger Live application are also likely to be upgraded.</p>

<p>Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier said that the funds in Series C opened up huge opportunities for them in the DeFi sector. It is gradually becoming mainstream and transforming the entire financial system as we know it. The company recorded a significant increase in revenue as early as the first quarter of 2021, and thanks to the new solutions, together with investors, they promise to continue this trend.</p>
<h2>The goals of Ledger and its investors are clear</h2>
<p>Permanent investors such as Cathay Innovation, Draper Associates, Draper Dragon, Draper Esprit, DCG and Wicklow Capital joined Series C. However, new companies have also appeared here - Tekne Capital, Uphold Ventures, Felix Capital, Inherent, Financiere Agache (Groupe Arnault) and iAngels Technologies. This only confirms that investments in the DeFi industry are attracting an increasing number of different entities.</p>
<p>Digital assets are becoming more and more common in everyday life, and Ledger believes that <strong>the volume of assets that is protected by their solutions will continue to grow.</strong>
 They would like to become a safe gateway to various DeFi ecosystems. They even managed to hire former executives of eToro and Opera.</p>
<p>However, not to praise Ledger, in December 2020, everything did not look smooth. A hole in the protection of personal data at that time caused a <strong>huge leak of up to 270,000 personal data</strong>
 of the company's customers. According to the report, the leak also involved 1 million emails from Ledger wallet owners as well as users registered to subscribe to their newsletter. However, the market seems to have forgiven them this mistake and continue to trust the company.</p>

<Excerpt>Ledger hardware wallet is one of the most used in the market. Therefore, we cannot really be surprised that they continue to work on the development of infrastructure and services for their clients. According to the latest information, the company is also heading to the DeFi industry.</Excerpt>

<Title>Taproot Locked-in: The biggest Bitcoin update is on the way</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>We will have to wait until November for real changes</h2>
<p>Taproot is an update of the current protocol in the form of a <strong>soft fork.</strong>
 To confirm it, the support of at least 90% of miners was needed, which was achieved well in advance in the last signalling period.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/taproot_signalling_period_of_2016_blocks_locked_in_86882c40bc.png" alt="Taproot signalling period of 2016 blocks locked-in">
<span class="img-caption">Taproot signalling period of 2016 blocks locked-in, Source: taproot.watch</span>
<p>Out of a total 2,016 blocks in this period, <strong>only a small number of blocks did not signal Taproot support.</strong>
 The support thus far exceeded the required 90%, which means that Taproot is currently in a "locked-in" state and its deployment is planned for November this year. Although the voting by signalling was not entirely unanimous, there was just a little missing. This means broad support for this update among miners, which is certainly great news.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Slush Pool mining pool signalled support for Taproot first and also mined a block with number 687 285, which was the one when the update was accepted. Other initial supporters included two pools with the largest share of hash rate - AntPool and F2Pool.</p>
<h2>Taproot changes Bitcoin in a fundamental way</h2>
<p>This is the first change of consensus since 2017 when SegWit was activated in August. From Bitcoin's point of view, it brings an extension of scripting possibilities, which should bring <strong>cheaper transactions,</strong>
 especially for multisigs and at the second layer. It will help <strong>increase privacy</strong>
 by hiding some information in transactions after activation. We should also not forget the fact that Bitcoin will also bring the <strong>support of smart contracts,</strong>
 which are the main driving force, for example, of the cryptocurrency Ethereum (ETH).</p>
<p>Many experts consider Taproot as the best means to increase privacy. Thanks to the update, the transaction in the Lightning Network channel will look indistinguishable from a sophisticated smart contract. <strong>Bitcoin blockchain currently reveals too much information</strong>
 about each transaction, especially in more complex operations. The new code will use the so-called <strong>Schnorr signature scheme,</strong>
 in which, for example, a multisig transaction does not look different from any other.</p>
<h2>The real solutions must now be presented to us by the developers</h2>
<p>We will probably all agree that this update will be an important contribution to the protocol and is a major step forward for Bitcoin's future. However, its activation is only the first step and the real work is just beginning. The ball is now on the side of the developers of various companies, who have to <strong>transform the mentioned advantages into real solutions</strong>
 and applications of everyday life.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>One of the most important events in the Bitcoin world in recent years took place on Saturday. June 12 will certainly be written in the history of cryptocurrencies in bold, and the novelty is the approval of the Bitcoin update called Taproot, which was approved by more than 90% of miners worldwide through signalling on mined blocks.</Excerpt>

<Title>Investro Tea: Week #24</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Covid news from Europe</h2>
<p>Almost all of Europe is now watching EURO 2020, which was postponed several times last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, it has already started and all 11 organising states will have to enforce certain constraints in order to be able to host a football match. This means that while in Budapest, Hungary, the stadium can have a full spectator capacity, in Amsterdam, Netherlands, it will be only 25% of the capacity of its stadium.</p>
<p>Last year, the Coronavirus pandemic also had a significant impact on tourism and some popular tourist destinations are financially dependent on it. Now, the beginning of summer is here, and with it also the awakening of tourism. Be that as it may, we should keep in mind that each European destination has its own rules.</p>

<h2>Technological news</h2>
<p>Amazon founder and one of the richest men on the planet, Jeff Bezos, is about to embark on a space flight with his brother. The third ticket in the Blue Origin ship was sold in an auction attended by six thousand people. The final cost of the flight ticket into orbit was $ 28 million. The name of the winner is still unknown.</p>
<p>The auction will go to the Blue Origin Foundation - Club for the Future, which aims to support the young in the study of science and technology with a focus on space technology.</p>
<p>See the video about the flight and the auction here:</p>

<Title>EUR/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.44%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.44%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.22%</strong>
 and -<strong>0.22%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was <strong>0.08%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-2</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the negative phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210615_Cycles_615f61a3f7.jpg" alt="EUR/USD daily price indextaion">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to the monthly MA, <strong>EUR/USD</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment, after falling below it last week. As we can see in the chart below, the 6 months and annual MAs are still in bullish sentiment. In the event of a decline, the 6-month MA can be an important support for the exchange rate.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210615_Mo_M_416c331c5d.jpg" alt="EUR/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>In the beginning of this year, there have been more downward trends, with a maximum of <strong>3</strong>
 consecutive days. Downward trends did not also exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. The maximum in the measured period is <strong>5</strong>
 days in downtrend and <strong>7</strong>
 days in uptrend. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.65%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.34%.</strong>
 Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.0%</strong>
 and <strong>1.0%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports medium-term bullish sentiment, as the exchange rate creates higher highs and higher lows. However, this has been corrected since the end of May. We can see a bullish divergence between the market price and the RSI. <strong>EUR/USD</strong>
 is currently approaching the important psychological level of <strong>1.2100</strong>
, where the short-term moving average is also located. In the event of a further decline, the demand zone (green rectangle), where there is also the long-term moving average and Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 could be the support for bulls.</p>

<Excerpt>The current price of the EUR/USD exchange rate is 1.2125 (June 15, 2021). The ECB monetary statement and inflation in the United States have been the most important fundamental data in recent days. They have since supported more USD. Let us therefore look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>The price of lumber is starting to return to normal</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The price of lumber on the stock exchange has been rising since April 2020. However, during this period, the price of these standardized derivatives (futures) was traded at $ 261, which was the bottom. Currently, a year later in May, it reached a record appreciation of up to 1700 USD. However, it is currently facing a relatively sharp drop of about 40% since its peak in May. The price thus begins to stabilize.
#Lumber and inflation</p>
<p>Economists and investors wondered whether the high prices of wood products would put an end to the boom in home construction in the United States. Builders logically increased house prices, due to higher construction timber costs (which experienced several times the price increase), and many stopped selling houses before the finalization of buildings to "misjudge" input price changes and not sell too cheaply.</p>
<p>Lumber is also referred to as a leading indicator of inflation. At this point, investors could not determine whether the rise in commodity prices and the impact of fiscal and monetary policy would cause a permanent increase in the price level or whether it was only a temporary increase due to the above factors. Below you can compare the development for 2020, 2021 and the price average 2015-2019. Currently, the price is significantly above the standard movement.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/wsj_average_dev_6dbe6d302c.png" alt="average development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: FactSet viac WSJ</span>
<p>The sharp decline indicates a bubble that has burst, and the question is how low wood prices will fall. Even after a sharp fall, the price for this commodity remains almost three times higher than the current standard, which is typical for this time of year. Manufacturers and timber traders expect prices to remain relatively high due to a strong housing market, but to reduce supply bottlenecks and insane purchases of furniture, homes and other wood products, which have characterized the reopening of the economy and caused significant price increases. Timber producers argue that prices should remain relatively high as domestic workers try to make up for the country's housing deficit. Mortgage-backing company Freddie Mac estimated in April that there were about 3.8 million homes in the United States that were avoiding meeting demand, mainly due to a lack of construction following the 2008 housing crash (WSJ).</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/lumber_chart_844da4a9bb.PNG" alt="Chart price">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Tradingview</span>
<p>From a short-term statistical point of view, we can see on the daily chart that the market has been declining very sharply in recent weeks. This is also indicated by an indicator that measures the distance of the price from the EMA 50 (exponential moving average over 50 days). According to him, from a short-term point of view, timber is very oversold and a correction upwards can be expected. The market is also attacked by the EMA 200. Just below the current price, there is strong support, in the red zone. Purchasing activity could be significantly increased in this zone.</p>
<h1>Statistics</h1>
<p>From a statistical point of view, the weekly chart makes a logical and necessary correction, after long weeks of growth. The timber market has been growing for 8 consecutive weeks, which can be considered a very strong extreme for building short positions. Currently, the market is declining for 4 weeks, which is quite logical after this growth. In this case, it is a non-standard situation, but it cannot be said that this is a complete extreme. Although even at this point there is a high chance that we will see 1-2 green candles on the weekly chart after 4 weeks of decline, we do not yet record a significant extreme. This would occur if the market were red for 5-6 weeks.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/lumber_weekly_development_c6cf9a8602.PNG" alt="weekly development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: Walfir</span>
<p>In the following histogram below, we can see the distribution of revenues on a weekly basis from 2010. In recent weeks, we have long been on the right. However, as the market declines in recent weeks and since its peak has lost more than 45% in about 6 weeks. We also have here the relative probabilities that can be expected for each week. <strong>The fact that the market will do more than 0% (will be positive) to 10% is a probability of 44.8%. However, this can be expected without extremes. As the market is declining for 4 consecutive weeks, the probability of growth in the next week will be significantly higher, and if we see a decline in the 5th week, the expected growth in the 6th week should be very likely.</strong>
</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: Walfir</span>
<p>Finally, we add the average gains for individual months since 2010. Here we can see that May is the most negative month and that seasonality plays a big role, especially in December, January and February. June is usually a statistically quite positive month.</p>

<Title>Fundament of the Week: What is sharding?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What is sharding?</h2>
<p>Sharding is a form of database partitioning, also known as horizontal partitioning. This process involves splitting a very large database into smaller, more manageable segments with the idea of improving performance and reducing request response time.</p>
<p>Sharding is not a new concept and has existed in traditional centralized database management since at least the 1990s. This term was popularized by one of the first mass multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) - Ultima Online. In that, the developers divided the players into different servers (worlds) to deal with the traffic better.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/sharding1_f79a75de07.JPG" alt="basic sharding demonstration">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Demonstration of sharding</span>
<p>In business, a common example of sharding is the <strong>division of customer databases according to geographical location</strong>
. Customers that are sharing similar geographical locations are grouped and located on the same servers.</p>
<h2>What is blockchain sharding?</h2>
<p>It is basically the same process. Blockchain is a database whose nodes represent individual data servers. If we use sharding on a blockchain, it would mean its <strong>division into individual segments (shards)</strong>
. Each shard would have a unique set of smart contracts and account balances.</p>
<p>The nodes would then be assigned to individual shards to authenticate transactions and operations, instead of every single node being responsible for verifying each transaction across the network.</p>
<p>The point is that splitting the blockchain into more manageable segments should increase transaction throughput, and thus overcome scalability issues that most blockchains are facing today.</p>
<h2>How does sharding work?</h2>
<p>For this explanation, we will use the Ethereum blockchain as an example. It is made up of thousands of computers called nodes. Each of the nodes lends a certain amount of hashing energy to the network. It is this hashing energy that enables the operation of the <strong>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)</strong>
 - i.e. the execution of intelligent contracts and the launch of decentralized applications (DApps).</p>
<p>Currently, Ethereum operates on a sequential basis, with each of these nodes having to count each individual operation and process each transaction. Therefore, a transaction that goes through this authentication process can take a long time. At present, Ethereum is around 3,000 transactions per second (TPS). For comparison - VISA can average up to 24,000 TPS. Adding computers to the network does not necessarily improve efficiency, as the entire ledger is stored on every single node, only extending the authentication chain.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/sharding2_58f39e9258.JPG" alt="what is sharding">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Example of sharding on the blockchain ecosystem</span>
<p>The idea of moving from a <strong>linear execution model</strong>
, in which each node must count each operation, to a <strong>parallel execution model</strong>
, in which nodes are assigned to process only some calculations, is linked to sharding. This will allow multiple parallel transaction processing simultaneously. The blockchain will be divided into separate shards. Nodes will only need to run the part of the ledger assigned to them in order to execute processes and verify transactions, instead of running the entire ledger.</p>
<h2>What problem can be solved by sharding?</h2>
<p>Sharding is a potential solution to persistent blockchain scalability issues. As mentioned above, one of the biggest problems that are blockchain networks nowadays facing is the issue of scalability. The more popular the blockchain network, the more users initiate transactions, decentralized applications, and other processes on the network.</p>
<p>Increased transaction activity puts increased demands on nodes that work to verify transactions, and there is a real risk that these blockchains may become clogged (as we saw on Ethereum, for example, during the CryptoKitties frenzy, when the game accounted for 11% of network transactions). If this happens, the speed of transactions will slow down significantly, which is not an ideal situation for the long-term sustainable adoption of a blockchain.</p>
<p>As we mentioned above, the blockchain is divided into smaller segments, with teams of nodes assigning responsibilities to individual segments. This means that each node will not have to maintain the entire ledger to perform each operation. Therefore, transaction confirmation may occur in a parallel rather than a linear manner, increasing the speed of the entire network. It provides a solution to the scalability issues of blockchain networks and therefore makes them more sustainable in the long run.</p>
<h2>Who implements sharding?</h2>
<p>Some blockchains have already implemented a protection mechanism, while others are still evolving. <strong>Zilliqa</strong>
 is the first public blockchain platform to implement sharding. In its test network, it managed to reach 2,828 TPS.</p>
<p>The <strong>Near</strong>
 blockchain ecosystem allows developers to easily create and deploy decentralized applications. Its sharding technology allows nodes to stay small enough to run on simple cloud-hosted cases — and mobile devices in the future. As in the case of Near, Ethereum provides a blockchain ecosystem for the implementation of DApps, based on smart contracts. Other blockchain projects that focus on sharding as a solution to scalability issues include <strong>Cardano, QuarkChain and Pchain</strong>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Technical Analysis of Bitcoin </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>On the daily chart, we can see one very strong support and resistance. Support is oscillating at around $ 28,841 - $ 30,364. Resistance at $ 46,423 - $ 49,063 and is pushing us from the top. These are sturdy levels that might prove difficult to overcome. In the coming weeks, I do not think it is probable that Bitcoin will come close to breaking through either of these two levels.</p>
<p>Also, on the way to the new ATH, this resistance will be, in my opinion, the biggest problem. If we look at the market in terms of cycles, then we had a really long growth here, which lasted more than 6 months. Then a drop followed, which got Bitcoin’s price to 50% of the previous ATH. This means that now a sideways movement should ensue. And that is exactly what is happening. We cannot be surprised that after such strong growth and following rapid decline, this is happening again. The market simply needs to "rest" and gain strength.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Technical analysis of Bitcoin on a daily chart</span>
<h2>4H chart</h2>
<p>As for the 4H chart, the conditions we are witnessing right now are really ideal for trading. Of course, HODL is a bit behind at the moment, because the price is not moving in trend. However, as far as trading on the 4H chart is concerned, I must point out here that Bitcoin now perfectly respects the selected levels.</p>
<p>By trading, USDT, and BTC you can get quite a nice profit. In order to achieve this, you need to execute shorter trades spanning from a few hours to a day in length and close positions on targets. This is currently the way to earn.</p>
<p>On the 4H chart, we can also see that Bitcoin is currently preparing for a break in local resistance. The resistance is worth $ 41,379 - 42,509. In my opinion, Bitcoin will tend to push for this resistance. However, the break will not be so easy. For a market in this state, a boring sideways movement is symptomatic. Subsequently, when no one will expect it, the movement in the given direction will eventually come.</p>

<Title>XCU/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.25%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.20%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.63%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.58%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>-1.49%</strong>
, which is slightly less than the 1st standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the very last negative phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. In the case of monthly MA, <strong>XCU/USD</strong>
 is clearly in bearish sentiment. The 6 months MA could be support for the price. The annual MA still supports bullish sentiment.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, we have witnessed more upward trends that did not exceed <strong>6</strong>
 consecutive days. The total maximum in the measured period (last 3 years) is <strong>11</strong>
 days. Downward trends in recent months have not exceeded more than <strong>2</strong>
 days. The total maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>12</strong>
 days. We could use the average annual ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.79%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>3.57%</strong>
, which is almost twice the average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-2.5%</strong>
 and <strong>2.5%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>3.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis shows short-term bearish sentiment, as the price of the commodity has been declining dynamically since the beginning of May. Above average volumes have also occurred in the last <strong>4</strong>
 days. <strong>XCU/USD</strong>
 is currently in the demand zone (green rectangle), where are also the psychological level of <strong>4.0000</strong>
 and the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
. However, the divergence between price development and the RSI could motivate bulls.</p>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: Grayscale adds 13 cryptocurrencies to its list</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>As many as 10 of the 13 cryptocurrencies added to the list of interest are from the DeFi industry</h2>
<p>On June 18, the well-known company Grayscale announced the expansion of its list of cryptocurrencies, which they are interested in and will monitor them more closely. Interestingly, most of this package consists of DeFi projects and concretely the following - <strong>Polygon (MATIC), Bancor (BNT), Curve (CRV), Loopring (LRC), Ren (REN), 1inch (1INCH), Universal Market Access (UMA), 0x (ZRX), Kava (KAVA) and Kyber Network (KNC).</strong>
 They are complemented by native tokens of high-speed scalable blockchain networks Dfinity, Solana and Near.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/grayscale_company_logo_seen_on_the_screen_of_smartphone_9888693fe1.jpg" alt="Grayscale company logo on the screen smartphone screen, placed on dollar bills">
<span class="img-caption">Grayscale company logo on the screen smartphone screen, placed on dollar bills, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>These are certainly not the only cryptocurrencies that Grayscale is examining in more detail and considering. After this last expansion, their number reached 31. The company currently offers products that monitor the performance of 13 different cryptocurrency assets.</p>
<h2>Interest does not have to mean transforming into a real product</h2>
<p>In March this year, Grayscale introduced <strong>5 new trust products</strong>
 that monitor the performance of these cryptocurrencies -, Filecoin, Chainlink, Decentraland, Livepeer and the Basic Attention Token. Together, these trusts represent only 0.1% of the total $ 34.4 billion, they report.</p>
<p>However, they add to the new report that the inclusion of a project on the list of interests does not mean that they will certainly present a product for a given cryptocurrency in the future. A good example is the cryptocurrencies EOS, Tezos and Cardano, which were on this list in the past, but the real product was not created.</p>
<h2>The DeFi industry is gaining momentum</h2>
<p>DeFi is often at the center of discussions about cryptocurrencies and their future direction. Well-known chains, such as Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which bring DeFi solutions directly to potential investors, are pushing it forward.</p>
<p>Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein also commented on the topic:</p>
<span class="post-quote">“We are to expand our product offerings to better serve our investors. The digital currency universe is constantly evolving and we seek to identify bold, interesting, and innovative opportunities that satisfy our investors.”</span>
<span class="quote-author">Michael Sonnenshein, CEO Grayscale</span>
<p>The company apparently sees a huge future in cryptocurrencies and is also increasingly <strong>interested in the DeFi industry.</strong>
 This has undergone a really dynamic development in recent years and <strong>its value is massively growing.</strong>
 Grayscale strives to provide its investors with easy and safe entry into this market. For any project, of course, it is a great success if they get on the mentioned list of Grayscale and even greater if the interest is subsequently transformed into a real trust product of this company.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Institutional asset manager Grayscale has been interested in the cryptocurrency sector for a long time. They have only recently expanded their list of interesting cryptocurrencies and a lot of them belongs to DeFi industry. This clearly shows growing interest in decentralized finances.</Excerpt>

<Title>MicroStrategy knows when to buy the dip</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Who's on the wave? BTC bulls or bears?</h2>
<p>The world of Bitcoin (BTC) is currently going through a very interesting period. On the one hand, we have <strong>negative news</strong>
 here from China, which, in addition to fundamentally tightening conditions for miners, has also pressured banks to put pressure on the crypto-related business. According to the published information, they should directly discourage their clients from crypto payments and also report transactions related to cryptocurrency exchanges and over-the-counter trading of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/businessman_with_red_cloth_and_big_bull_shadow_0dc65cd6e1.jpg" alt="Businessman with red cloth and big bull shadow">
<span class="img-caption">Businessman with red cloth and big bull shadow, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>Bitcoin fans can also enjoy a lot of positive news.</strong>
 Probably the most discussed is the adoption of <strong>BTC as a legal currency in El Salvador,</strong>
 which is likely to be followed soon by other countries. It is certainly worth mentioning the <strong>recent update of the BTC protocol known as Taproot,</strong>
 which we reported on in a separate article. We certainly consider the current news about the recent large purchase of Bitcoin by MicroStrategy as a bullish signal also.</p>
<p>The market is reacting rather embarrassingly to this mix of news, and it does not yet seem clear which direction BTC will take in the near future. Almost immediately after the "Chinese" news, its price dropped to about $ 31,000 and rose slightly after today's tweet of MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, hovering just over $ 32,500 at the time of writing.</p>
<h2>The best investors know how to take full advantage of the bad mood in the market and the panic of retail when shopping</h2>
<p>The mentioned drop in the price of Bitcoin was obviously a good signal for MicroStrategy to buy more. The company announced that it had <strong>purchased an additional 13,005 BTC</strong>
 for an average price of $ 37,617. Together, they <strong>invested nearly half a billion dollars in BTC</strong>
 in this purchase. The whole trade, of course, took place through the OTC market, so the price of BTC reacted with a slight increase only after the publication of the report. <strong>MicroStrategy currently owns 105,085 BTC worth a total of almost $ 3 billion.</strong>
</p>
<p>The company's confidence in the positive future of the largest cryptocurrency is more than obvious. For the last purchase, they borrowed money from their investors by issuing bonds worth half a billion. According to the original plan, it was supposed to be $ 400 million, but in the end, they decided to increase by another $ 100 million. MicroStrategy has thus become <strong>Bitcoin's largest known institutional hodler,</strong>
 leaving others such as Tesla and Square far behind in the dust.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>The most famous cryptocurrency Bitcoin is not currently experiencing the best period in terms of price. After the negative news, which comes mainly from China, it fell to about $ 31,000. For many investors, such drops represent an ideal buying opportunity, and the well-known software company MicroStrategy has decided to take a similar step.</Excerpt>

<Title>GBP/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.43%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.43%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.21%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.21%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was <strong>0.61%</strong>
, which is between the first and second standard deviation. Our scoring is currently negative (<strong>-2</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that the periodic change is negative, and the indexation is in an extreme declining phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to the monthly MA, <strong>GBP/USD</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment, after falling below it last week. As we can see in the chart below, the 6 months and annual MAs are still in bullish sentiment. In the event of a decline, the 6-month MA can be an important support for the exchange rate.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>There have been more downward trends since our last analysis. In the recent week month, a maximum of <strong>5</strong>
 consecutive days was reached. This is even more than during the outbreak of <em>COVID-19</em>
. However, upward trends in the same period did not exceed more than <strong>2</strong>
 days. The maximum in the measured period is <strong>8</strong>
 days in the downtrend and <strong>9</strong>
 days in the uptrend. To estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions, we could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.85%</strong>
). The current value is <strong>0.93%</strong>
, which normal. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1%</strong>
 and <strong>1%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports bullish sentiment, as the exchange rate creates higher highs and higher lows. In addition, <strong>GBP/USD</strong>
 has also recently been close to the demand zone (green rectangle) with a strong bottom, where are the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 and the long-term moving average. The divergence between price development and the RSI could also motivate short-term bulls. However, the short-term MA together with the psychological level of <strong>1.4000</strong>
 may represent resistance to the exchange rate.</p>

<Title>Investro Tea: Week #25</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Cars, planes, and engines</h2>
<p>And let us start with a piece of dramatic news. The senior management, including CFO and president, of Lordstown Motors (RIDE shares), sold $ 8 million worth of company shares in March, shortly before the announcement of unsatisfactory results. They are, therefore, likely to be investigated by securities commissions. Which, of course, does not benefit the company in any way.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lordstown-motors-executives-sold-stock-ahead-of-reporting-results-and-before-troubles-came-to-light-11624273380">read more about this case at The Wall Street Journal</a>
.</p>
<p>American Airlines is experiencing a personnel crisis, part of which is affecting also the aircraft maintenance department. One of the biggest airline companies in the world must therefore disrupt hundreds of flights. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/american-airlines-cancels-hundreds-flights-due-staffing-crunch-maintenance-issues-n1271536">You can read about this in full on NBC news</a>
.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: American Airlines - aa.com</span>
<p>The automotive company Volvo and the Swedish battery manufacturer Northvolt will build a joint factory for electric car batteries. It will be built in Europe and the goal is to produce up to 500,000 Batteries per year. Production could begin in 2026. This goes hand in hand with Volvo's plan - to produce only electrically powered cars starting from 2030.</p>
<p>Now, let us stay in the field of electric cars for a while longer. Canoo is planning to build its first car factory in Oklahoma. The company does not focus on sports cars, but rather on inner-city transport vehicles in the form of black pickups and vans with a possibility of prepaid battery recharge service paid for in the form of a flat rate. Canoo shares are currently being traded at $ 10 and the company's price estimate is $ 1.8 billion. We will see whether it will come anywhere close to the prices of Tesla or, conversely, a number of less successful companies in the field of electromobility.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: Canoo </span>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that Ford is also investing in electromobility by the acquisition of Electriphi.</p>
<h2>Semiconductors</h2>
<p>In recent weeks, in Investro Tea,  we have mentioned that a number of countries, such as Japan and, most recently, the United States, led by Biden, want to support local production of scarce computer chips. The latest proposal from the US Congress is to give semiconductor companies a 25% tax break. This trend of supporting this industry’s segment is likely to continue.</p>

<Title>Fundament of the week - SegWit</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What is SegWit?</h2>
<p>SegWit is the name of the Bitcoin Protocol (BTC) update, which was implemented on August 23, 2017. Its concept was formulated by BTC developer Pieter Wuille.</p>
<p>As with any decentralized blockchains, if it is necessary to update the BTC algorithm, it is up to the developers to agree on how and when to make these changes all at once. In this way, the SegWit update was designed to help scale BTC and fix some of the bugs that posed a risk. SegWit is best known for the way it updates how the data is stored on the BTC blockchain.</p>
<p>SegWit is the process of increasing the block size limit on a blockchain by removing signature data from BTC transactions. Once certain parts of a transaction are deleted, it frees up space or capacity that can be then used to accommodate more transactions to the chain.</p>
<li>SegWit is a BTC-related action that is designed to help increase the block size limit on a blockchain</li>
<li>SegWit helps increase the block size limit by extracting signature data from BTC transactions</li>
<li>The term SegWit means segregated witnesses (who are signed under transactions)</li>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/fundament_segwit_1_aad7bef513.JPG" alt="Segwit block vs non-segwit blocks">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Comparison of Non-SegWit vs SegWit block solution</span>
<h2>Understanding SegWit</h2>
<p>Bitcoin blockchain consists of several systems distributed in a peer-to-peer network. These systems are called nodes and serve as BTC transaction managers/overseers. All transactions made in the BTC are duplicated across these nodes, making it virtually impossible to penetrate and damage the transaction.</p>
<p>Transaction data that is shared on multiple nodes consists of two components - <strong>inputs and outputs</strong>
. More than one input and output can be involved in a transaction. The output means the public address of the recipient. By input, we mean the public address of the sender. The sender needs the public address of the recipient in order to send him the funds. Most of the space in a transaction is taken up by a signature, a part of the entry, that verifies that the sender has the necessary means to make the payment. Thus, Bitcoin moves from inputs to outputs for each transmitted transaction. If each of the nodes validates the transaction as valid at once, the transaction is included in the block that is then added to the string or the general ledger for public access.</p>
<h2>Challenges for BTC platforms</h2>
<p>The problem facing the BTC platform is that if more and more transactions are taking place, more blocks need to be added to the chain. Blocks are generated every 10 minutes and are limited to a maximum size of 1 MB. Due to this limitation, only a certain number of transactions can be added to a block. The weight of the transactions represented by the blocks weighs down the network and causes delays in processing and verifying transactions. In some cases, it takes several hours for the transaction to be confirmed. Imagine all the BTC transactions that have taken place since the inception of BTC in 2009, if they were still dwelling on a blockchain and still accumulating. <strong>In the long run, the system would not be sustainable without radical change</strong>
.</p>
<p>At a basic level, SegWit is a process that changes the way data is stored, helping the bitcoin network run faster and more smoothly.</p>
<h2>SegWit designed as a solution</h2>
<p>BTC developer, Dr. Pieter Wuille, suggests that to solve this problem, it is necessary to separate the digital signature from the transaction data. The process is known as "segregated witness" or SegWit. A digital signature represents 65% of the space in a given transaction. SegWit attempts to ignore the data attached to the signature by deleting the signature from inside the input and moving it to the structure at the end of the transaction. This would increase the 1 MB limit for block size to almost 4 MB. In addition to increasing the capacity of the blocks, SegWit also solves the problem when the receiver can capture and modify the sender's transaction identifier in an attempt to obtain more coins from him. Because the digital signature would be separated from the input, the unscrupulous party would not be able to change the transaction ID without revoking the digital signature.</p>
<h2>Why is the adoption of SegWit still incomplete?</h2>
<p>SegWit was not fully accepted by all participants in the BTC network because it is not mandatory, but also due to different incentives among users in the ecosystem. Despite the advantages of the SegWit segment, not all participants in the BTC network have implemented it. This shows us what roles individuals play in the entire BTC network and how sometimes conflicting incentives contradict each other.</p>
<p>For example, BTC is not just an "upgrade" - it relies on wallets, exchanges, and companies to use it to innovate and send changes to the network accordingly. No one is required to accept a SegWit segment. It is up to the engineering teams to put their organizations in the right direction. Which cannot always be expected to happen.</p>
<p>By the time SegWit appeared, there were already billions in the BTC market, so the corporate bureaucracy consisted only of a small fraction of these companies that were acting agile. The final decision on whether to launch SegWit with new software and economic updates or maintain the status quo is often in the hands of reluctant executives, not enthusiasts. Another unbalanced stimulus is the motivation of miners, who preferred the use of AsicBoost firmware. It was incompatible with the SegWit segment but reportedly helped them verify transactions up to 20% faster.</p>
<p>As the price of BTC rises and the whole ecosystem becomes busier, users are attracted to more efficient solutions with SegWit support. This forces companies to adapt.</p>
<p>BTC is slowly recovering from the fall in 2018 and 2019. The fees that users pay for transactions are also rising. Using a wallet with SegWit support is advantageous because the transaction blocks processed by the miners serving these wallets have a higher weight (i.e., transaction density) leading to speed and cost-efficiency. The migration of users to these wallets and SegWiit tools has been greatly accelerated. Since 2019, SegWit segment consumption has increased from 39% to more than 50.5%.</p>

<Title>Commodity analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Gold</h2>
<p>Gold reached its absolute peak on August 7, 2020, at 2077 USD per ounce. At that time, the state of the gold market looked really promising as it was the first one to be able to get back on track from the plunge caused by the COVID pandemic. Likewise, with COVID and various measures, the economy was expected to slow down resulting in investors seeking safe harbor.</p>
<p>However, then the central banks, led by the Fed, began to react and started vehemently releasing liquidity on a large scale into the market. As a result, traditional markets such as stocks and indices continued to grow. People began to get the impression that, thanks to these stimuli, the economy would go up anyway and, therefore, they did not need to invest so conservatively (i.e. in gold). In my opinion, this is the main factor why gold had its maximum last year in August and has been declining since then.</p>
<p>At this point, gold is in this big channel which will have to overcome. Until then, the gold will be still moving in the same descending pattern. As has been the case for almost a year now.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/SILVER_GOLD_1_27ef9104f2.JPG" alt="Gold Chart">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Technical analysis of gold</span>
<h2>Silver</h2>
<p>The same market psychology that was affecting the gold market, could be applied also to silver. This precious metal had its maximum in the current trend also on 08/07/2020. However, unlike gold, silver did not reach its all-time high, as gold did. After its sharp rise, which happened right after the COVID slump, the silver consolidated and is currently continuing to the side. We can see a nice triangle on the chart. We are held down by a rising trend from below and strong resistance from above, which holds the level of 30 USD.</p>
<p>However, the principle is the same. Silver will go nowhere until it reaches the level of 30 USD. While we are in this big triangle, the silver can make smaller ripples down and up, but the trend will still continue to the side.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/SILVER_GOLD_2_ebdac5eb89.JPG" alt="Technical analysis of Silver">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Technical analysis of silver</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The fact that traditional markets continue to grow does not look promising for gold and silver. Many investors expected that with the breakout of the COVID pandemic last year, gold and silver would shoot up, which kind of happened, but since then, nothing worth mentioning has happened for almost a year. Of course, from the longer investment horizon, the growth is certain, but at the moment this side movement may take some time. I would recommend observing these key values as well as following the macroeconomic news. As both Gold and silver could be helped by some shocks in the classic markets or by panic sentiment. Should markets remain calm, the gold and silver would not have the need to break through their current state.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Technical Analysis of Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Wyckoff method is a theoretical model with which description can be found in the picture below.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/wyckof_0ecc53ffdb.png" alt="Wyckoff method scheme">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: The Wyckoff method scheme</span>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/wyckoff2_f9d3fa0652.png" alt="Wyckoff method on current BTC chart">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: The Wyckoff method on current Bitcoin chart</span>
<p>The similarity is really striking. These sideways movements are often accompanied by false signals. The last was, for example, just a breakthrough in the new LOW, which could tell us that the current support will not last and the price will go even lower. However, that did not happen. This sideways moving structure tends to discourage traders, especially beginner ones. It is still the same repetitive cycle. The period of growth which attracts many newcomer traders is always followed by a similar scenario. Often ending up with many of them selling their BTC and leaving the market for good.</p>
<p>From the market psychology point of view, fundamentals are also largely involved. If you notice, there is always a negative fundamental accompanying the price whenever it comes near to the support. such as with miners in China or the decline of HASHrate. On the other hand, whenever we approach resistance, positive news comes to the market such as those from El Salvador and the like.</p>
<h2>4H chart</h2>
<p>At this point, I expect a smaller decline on the 4H chart, but growth on BTC could return again over the weekend. Overall, we have broken the downward trend with a decent volume, and growth should therefore continue. I consider this broken trend we are witnessing as the strongest support which the BTC could test at this moment. The same goes for MA21.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_25_6_bb2ca246a8.JPG" alt="default">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 3: BTC on a 4H chart</span>
<p>Determining the direction and some longer-term trends of Bitcoin is currently very difficult, so I would recommend trading mainly on the 4H chart. Because Bitcoin is in a sideways motion and does not have a clear direction. The only thing we can do is open long positions in the growth to resistance and, conversely, go short on the decline to support. It is challenging and one day it may not work out for us. This will be exactly when Bitcoin gets out of range and definitely decides which side to go.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Today, we will look again at the technical analysis of Bitcoin, which is still more or less in the same range. Moreover, it seems that we are close to the theoretical Wyckoff method.</Excerpt>

<Title>XAU/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.77%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.77%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.40%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.36%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>0.29%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>3</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>3</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
, which means that we estimate the first very positive growth phase of the cycle. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. <strong>XAU/USD</strong>
 recently fell below the medium-term MA. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, all MAs currently support bearish sentiment.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Recently, we have witnessed more downward trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>5</strong>
 consecutive days. However, the maximum decrease was <strong>6</strong>
 days in the measured period. Since our last analysis, the upward trends have not exceeded more than <strong>8</strong>
 days, which is also the maximum for the last <strong>3</strong>
 years. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.57%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.93%</strong>
, which is well below its long-term average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.6%</strong>
 and <strong>1.6%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>2.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis supports short-term bearish sentiment after a dynamic decline in the previous week. <strong>XAU/USD</strong>
 is currently very close to the support level of <strong>1 760</strong>
, where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50.00%</strong>
. However, the divergence between price development and the RSI, which has developed since April, could support the bullish pullback. If the price continues to fall, the demand zone (green rectangle), where are also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>61.80%</strong>
 and the psychological level of <strong>1 700</strong>
, could also provide some support for the bulls.</p>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: This industry will destroy the banks as we know them</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>We are witnessing a great battle for consumer deposits</h2>
<p>Analysts often refer to this struggle as <strong>the battle of the century.</strong>
 It will take place between traditional finances with their representatives in the form of commercial banks and the decentralized finances industry - DeFi. You may think that the world of finance is run by huge multinational companies, but the truth is that <strong>the main driver of the global economy is retail.</strong>
 They currently interact with the financial world almost exclusively through commercial banks, to which they are often giving all their funds.</p>
<p>Most people have a negative or, at best, neutral relationship with their bank and that is not a surprise. <strong>Banks are known for their outdated services and unfair practices</strong>
 - hidden fees, slow transfers and especially the worst interest rates you can imagine. These user experiences almost border with a hostile environment. In addition, the situation is not made easier for banks by regulations, which fundamentally reduce their ability to bring various innovations or secure profit.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/defi_decentralized_3d_illustration_82d0b1c2f9.jpg" alt="DeFi - Decentralized 3D illustration">
<span class="img-caption">DeFi - Decentralized 3D illustration, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<h2>DeFi has a huge opportunity to take control of global finances</h2>
<p>Of course, companies operating in DeFi are aware of this situation and are literally turning the current model of working with funds upside down. In the future, we are likely to see such a fundamental change as the adoption of the Internet brought in this market. Users will be able to enjoy <strong>absolute control over their finances,</strong>
 with virtually no restrictions. There will also be a possibility to change the service provider within few seconds, with just few mouse clicks.</p>
<p>In the world of retail banking, the system is based on the fact that we must trust people in the management of banks. This trust is quite expensive and does not always pay off. In contrast, in the new decentralized world, we rely on smart contracts and their code, the main advantage of which is that it has no interests of its own. In addition, these <strong>services work 24/7, 365 days a year</strong>
 and all of that without any employees. They are turning traditional financial processes into fully automated programs.</p>
<p>In DeFi, <strong>capital can flow into the best opportunities almost immediately,</strong>
 and these innovations bring real competition to the financial world. This is the main reason why DeFi will sooner or later kill commercial banks. If the user can get double-digit interest rates in his preferred decentralized application, why would he leave the money in the bank?</p>
<h2>Decentralized finance has another ace up its sleeve</h2>
<p>It goes without saying that with industry as young as DeFi, we are still witnessing intensive development and a wealth of innovation. One of the technology progresses that the industry could significantly benefit from is <strong>artificial intelligence and machine learning.</strong>
 These technologies bring a whole new level of efficiency to the world of finance and, combined with DeFi, could be a real revolution.</p>
<h2>It is important to work on the shortcomings</h2>
<p>The need for an accessible and transparent financial system is becoming increasingly clear. DeFi is working to replace outdated systems, highlighting the failures of traditional centralized entities and providing a viable option for global financial freedom.</p>
<p>To date, however, DeFi has recorded <strong>more than $ 285 million in hacker attacks</strong>
 on the Ethereum blockchain alone. In addition, Ethereum is significantly <strong>overloaded in terms of transactions</strong>
 and its use is for now <strong>relatively expensive.</strong>
 In this example, it is clear that there is still a lot of work and development ahead for DeFi. Its main advantage - automated process control, is also the biggest challenge. We will have to wait a while for a state where we can absolutely rely on DeFi smart contracts. But then the financial world will experience a real battle from which traditional finance and banks, with the current set-up, are unlikely to emerge victorious.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>From the name "decentralized finance", it is clear that the coming competition should be of particular concern to the banks, which are currently the main point of the retail-financial clash. According to many, commercial banks, as we know them, will even disappear completely.</Excerpt>

<Title>Binance and the current bans – real problems or unnecessary FUD? </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>United Kingdom as the biggest hit?</h2>
<p>What seemed like the biggest hit was the latest issue of FCA (Financial Conduct Authority), which  stated that Binance Markets Limited does not have a necessary license in to be functioning in the country. What seemed as one of the worst news in the cryptocurrency world however turned out to be only a FUD spread by those, who did not actually read into the statement.</p>
<p>Binance Markets Limited is not operating Binance.com. This website, where vast majority of the trading happens, is operated by Binance Group, which was not part of the FCA warning. Therefore, for retail traders in the United Kingdom nothing changes and the initial scare was completely unnecessary.</p>
<h2>Japan and Canada</h2>
<p>However, Binance seems to be having more problems. FSA (Financial Service Agency), regulator in Japan warned the exchange to be careful with its steps. Same type of warning already pushed Binance to a more drastic steps in Ontario.
In this province in Canada, Binance will not offer its services anymore (from the start of the year 2022), because the Ontario Securities Commission, biggest financial regulator in the province, demanded from the Binance exchange several compliance, legal and financial steps that the exchange deemed as unimportant.</p>
<p>Yet, none of these news does not have significant effect on the cryptocurrency market. Obviously, these news are not the best for the biggest cryptocurrency exchange, however, they seem to be emerging at the time of “organized chaos or fud.”  Therefore, if you are in this market, be sure to always check the relevance of the information, since many online magazines or financial websites seemed to misinterpret this information, which lead to spreading of the fud.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>One of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance, has been dealing with great amount of regulators for past couple of days. Canada, Japan and United Kingdom has all filed different statements about this exchange, none of which are too pleasing.</Excerpt>

<Title>El Salvador is serious about adopting Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>A big and important milestone for Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>You have certainly read or heard about the official acceptance of Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador. It is the first country in the world to take this step. El Salvador is currently in the sight of crypto enthusiasts as well as sceptics. This is the first opportunity to <strong>monitor the use of Bitcoin by the entire state and nation.</strong>
 President Nayib Bukele points out, in particular, that <strong>up to 70% of their citizens do not have their own bank account</strong>
 and therefore have no access to financial services. Bitcoin should solve this problem in El Salvador.</p>
<p>The law recognizing Bitcoin as a legal tender was passed on June 9 and will take effect on September 7. President said that they are currently taking all the necessary steps to ensure that everything is ready by then. Among other things, they are working on the development of their own government electronic wallet Chivo, and a number of cryptomats (crypto ATMs) should be installed in the country.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/el_salvador_bitcoin_flag_c780c89b6d.jpg" alt="El Salvador bitcoin flag">
<span class="img-caption">El Salvador bitcoin flag, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<h2>The criticism did not take long</h2>
<p>Of course, the information about this adoption of Bitcoin did not escape from negative reactions either. <strong>The IMF has pushed on El Salvador</strong>
 by saying that the adoption of Bitcoin could seriously disrupt negotiations on a $ 1 billion loan. The country also <strong>asked the World Bank for help with this process, but they strongly rejected</strong>
 its involvement in it. They cited issues related to environmental protection and the transparency of Bitcoin as reasons, why WB did not want to engage.</p>
<p>However, President Bukele is determined to continue without the help of these institutions. In his opinion, it makes no sense to fight them, and plans to build a Bitcoin infrastructure. He points to the fact that up to 62 out of 84 voted for the law, which is more than two-thirds of the congress seats - supermajority. Officials added that the US dollar remains legal tender also.</p>
<h2>First state electronic wallet and the first state airdrop of Bitcoin</h2>
<p>El Salvador also wants to help with the acceptance of Bitcoin in the country with the announced <strong>airdrop, in which every adult citizen could get $ 30 in BTC.</strong>
 Altogether, up to 4.5 million people could participate, representing an airdrop worth $ 195 million. <strong>Bitcoin's global user base could grow by up to 2.5%.</strong>
 With this step, the government wants to motivate the population to try cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>An interesting feature of the whole process is certainly the <strong>development of the state electronic wallet,</strong>
 which will be issued on September 7 and was introduced under the name Chivo. Why is this wallet needed? The government says the answer is simple - logistics. There are a number of e-wallet providers on the market and it would be quite difficult for public authorities to find out who has already participated in airdrop and who has not. They add that once accepted, residents can send BTC to any other wallet, but there will be a record. In addition to cryptocurrencies, Chivo should also support the holding of the USD.</p>
<h2>What will it look like in practice?</h2>
<p>The new law states that <strong>every economic entity must accept payment in Bitcoin</strong>
 if the customer chooses this form. The president adds that the exception is if someone does not have access to the technology needed to receive Bitcoin. However, pensions and salaries will continue to be paid in US dollars, as well bank account balances. The state is planning various training courses and support mechanisms to help the population in adopting the new technology.</p>
<p>It is not yet clear how many residents will decide to actually accept Bitcoin into their daily lives. However, the country is currently under the scrutiny of a number of observers who are particularly interested in the effects of this step on various aspects of the state's economy.</p>
<p>Interesting note: The president said that there will be an opportunity to obtain citizenship of El Salvador, with the investment of at least 3 BTC in the economy of the state.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>The news of the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador almost immediately flew around the world. Not all reactions have been positive, but the president says the process can no longer be stopped. In this context, the government is also developing its own electronic wallet and is also preparing an extensive airdrop.</Excerpt>

 and <strong>-0.44%</strong>

. Yesterday´s return was <strong>-0.11%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>2</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>3</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the positive phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the beginning of <strong>2021</strong>
, there have been more upward trends, where we have also recorded a medium-term maximum of <strong>6</strong>
 consecutive days. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. However, the maximum decrease was <strong>7</strong>
 days in the measured period. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.55%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.37%</strong>
, which is below average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.00%</strong>
 and <strong>1.00%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>The basic technical analysis shows the testing of this year’s highs. The exchange rate is still in a short-term uptrend, as it creates higher highs and higher lows. Breaking above the psychological level of <strong>111.00</strong>
 could motivate bulls. The <strong>USD/JPY</strong>
 is also currently far from the short-term moving average, which could act as support in the event of a pull back down. The divergence between pair development and the RSI, which has been created since the end of March, also supports this scenario. The demand zone (green rectangle) can be an important area in that case.</p>

<Title>Investro Tea: Week #26</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Allbirds is a New Zealand-American company founded in 2016, specializing in the production of woolen sneakers, which are gaining worldwide popularity. Their Wool Runner shoe is made of New Zealand's very fine Merino Wool.</p>
<p>In 2019, they already achieved sales of over USD 100 million and are now preparing for their IPO, with Morgan Stanley as their partner. The company is currently valued at two billion dollars so let’s see how entering the stock exchange will work out for them.</p>

<h2>Computer chips and space</h2>
<p>The company, known worldwide for its Nvidia graphics cards for PC gamers (and frequently bought by crypto miners), has submitted an offer to buy the British group Arm Ltd, which is engaged in the production of semiconductors. Currently, semiconductors are in acute shortage on the global market. The British government has given support to this trade.</p>
<p>Despite the current shortage of chips, there are two companies that are well stock up on them. These are the space company Blue Origin owned by Jeff Bezos, which plans to fly into space with a live crew on July 20. And also Virgin Galactic owned by Richard Branson which had a successful test flight on May 22.</p>
<p>The two companies focus on space tourism, while Elon's SpaceX focuses more on commercial flights.</p>

<h2>Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>It wouldn't be Investro Tea if we did not focus on cryptocurrencies, at least briefly. This time it will be neither Bitcoin, Ethereum, nor Dogecoin and we will not even mention Elon Musk. This time, it will be Segwit. You can read what Segwit means and what impact it will have on cryptocurrency markets and technologies <a href="https://investro.com/crypto/fundament-of-the-week-seg-wit">here</a>
.</p>
<p>And the latest news today is that Mexican Billionaire Ricardo Salina Pliego has announced that his bank, Banco Azteca, will be the first in the country to start receiving BTC. On his Twitter, he recommended all investors to start reading up on cryptocurrencies. You can <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-price-climbs-after-mexican-billionaire-urges-people-to-buy-11624884347?mod=hp_lead_pos5">read more</a>

<Excerpt>This week’s investro tea will be quite different as we will take a closer look at a topic which is not often discussed here - shoes. But in order not to go too far away from the usual, we will mention also computer chips and ongoing private space races.</Excerpt>

<Title>Technical Analysis of Stock Indices</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>S&P500</h2>
<p>If we look at the daily chart, we see that we are currently at a new maximum. It is also quite obvious where the plunge caused by the COVID pandemic took place. Be that as it may, the S&P500 quickly gained momentum and started growing back to its former glory. Currently, the S&P500 is holding the trend, and whenever there is a slump, it is immediately followed by a new high.</p>
<p>Whether this state of the chart reflects the real state of the economy is worth considering. For me, the daily chart is unsustainable in the long term and is held mainly by the Fed's policy. The trend is your friend until the end, so as long as we keep the lower trend, I would still go long. However, one day there will be another slump deviating the price from trend only this time, the drawn up will not be as quick.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/Investro_stock_1_068486f8e3.JPG" alt="S&P500 on a daily chart">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: S&P500 index on a daily chart</span>
<h2>NASDAQ</h2>
<p>The Nasdaq is a technology index, which I think currently looks even worse. It has also recovered very quickly after the COVID, then formed a triangle formation, and has been growing under a very sharp trend for a long time. Also, the only thing that keeps the NASDAQ in such a state is the trend. Shares of technology companies have been among the most promising recently. Shares like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, or Netflix were left almost unscathed by COVID or even came out stronger than before.</p>
<p>However, if we look at the last growth, we see that its angle is increasing. Even in this case, the trend is your friend until the end, but it is obvious here too that one severe price plunge is what keeps the current trend on NASDAQ from ending. Because at a current angle of growth, the Nasdaq will not last long.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: NASDAQ on a daily chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>At this point, we can see that both S&P500 and NASDAQ are still in good shape, but we can already see some weaknesses, especially in the Dow Jones index. Which we will analyze next week. The only thing that keeps the indices in such growth and their price so high is the policy of the Fed and the trend. However, once the indices fall through the trends, it will get serious.</p>

<Excerpt>Last week we gave you a brief introduction to commodities and today we would like to continue in a similar way but with stock indices. Namely, it will be the S&P 500 and NASDAQ.</Excerpt>

<Title>Fundament of the week - SegWit2x</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The crypto market is still growing, and, contrary to popular belief, this success (of Bitcoin in particular) can hamper the progress of virtual currencies. This can lead to an increase in transaction fees and processing times.</p>
<h2>Hard fork and soft fork</h2>
<p>To understand the SegWit2x segment, we first need to know the difference between hard and soft fork that is related to blockchain. Hard fork refers to reworking the rules governing the blockchain. This is a major design shift, so new blocks are not considered valid by old networking software.</p>
<p>The result of a hard fork is that the affected blockchain is permanently divided into two. Hard forks can even split a network into two if they are not fully adopted. All you need to have is the right amount of cooperation between participants. The proposed hard fork can still split the blockchain. This was the case when Ethereum was divided as a result of the hacking of the DAO.</p>
<p>Soft forks, on the other hand, are a shift in network regulations creating blocks and as such are recognized by previous software. In this sense, they are poorly compatible.</p>
<h2>SegWit as the background of the SegWit2x segment</h2>
<p>Before the SegWit2x segment design came along, there was SegWit. It was the first soft fork designed to address the issue of Bitcoin scalability. It was designed in 2015 by Pieter Wuille.</p>
<p>The segregated witness mechanism was designed to allow separation between signatures and other transaction data. As the result, the data would be stored within various blocks. The goal of the SegWit segment was to increase the total transaction capacity through a non-splitting software mechanism.</p>
<p>Ever since the SegWit design was conceived, further discussions about the branching of the BTC network have taken place. For example, the hard fork, which took place in August 2017, led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash. As a result, the block size increased eightfold without having to use the SegWit protocol. SegWit was finally activated on August 24, 2017, although many BTC network transactions did not take advantage of this innovation at the time.</p>
<h2>SegWit2x as a hard fork design</h2>
<p>While SegWit was a soft fork design, SegWit2x was a hard fork design. The launch of SegWit in August 2017, was actually only the first of two-phases referred to as the "New York Agreement".</p>
<p>The second phase is the so-called Segwit2x protocol, which would increase blocking from 1 MB to 2 MB. The designers of the SegWit2x segment hoped that the increase in blocking would be able to mitigate the increase in transaction fees. These grow as a result of users paying miners for transactions. On the other hand, increasing the block size would also put more burden on node operators, who would then be required to store additional data.</p>
<p>SegWit2x segment implementation would lead to a change in the rules governing Bitcoin. On the other hand, it would be different from the forks that led to Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Gold. In these cases, users expected that the transactions themselves would not be dramatically affected. Rather, users who already owned Bitcoin would simply be provided with a new cryptocurrency during an ongoing fork, and the two networks would continue on different routes.</p>
<p>Like these previous forks, SegWit2x was an alternative software protocol that would result in a hard fork and in an attempt to increase the block size. However, unlike previous forks, SegWit2x tried to keep all existing BTC users on one blockchain.</p>
<h2>Pros and cons</h2>
<p>The miners and startups who led the adoption of the SegWit2x segment tended to be the loudest supporters of the new protocol. They have often argued that Bitcoin's inactivity is causing competing cryptocurrencies to overtake Bitcoin’s place and that existing improvements are not sufficient to alleviate the problem.</p>
<p>On the other hand, developers and node operators have often been not in favor of these changes. They suggested that Bitcoin could serve the purpose of storing the value rather than playing the role of the payment system and that the riskiness of the new protocol outweighs its potential benefits. Some also thought that miners and businesses would benefit disproportionately from the protocol.</p>
<p>SegWit2x was very controversial, partly due to its status as a hard fork and the developers were unable to reach a consensus on its adoption. The hard fork was originally scheduled for November 16, 2017. However, the leaders of the SegWit2x movement suspended it on November 8, 2017, due to ongoing disagreements and a lack of consensus among the participants.</p>
<p>At the end of 2017, another proposed fork called SegWit2x was announced, however, it seems that it has nothing to do with the original segment except for the name.</p>

<Excerpt>Although bitcoin still remains the most important cryptocurrency today, it is far from perfect. Among the biggest challenges it faces is scalability. Some blocks in the BTC blockchain are limited to 1 MB, having only a limited number of transactions that the network can process.</Excerpt>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday - On-chain analysis of Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>In today's analysis, I will look at 4 basic parameters that must change in order for Bitcoin to grow again and reach new highs. In this article, I will be using the statistics sourced from the Glassnode analytical portal.</p>
<h2>1. Hash rate</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_2_7_obr_1_5d2d38c7c5.png" alt="Hash rate of BTC ">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: BTC hash rate</span>
<p>The first parameter is the Hash rate. It has long been known that the Hash rate has a direct effect on the price of Bitcoin. At the moment, however, the Hash rate has fallen sharply due to the fact that miners in China are ceasing their activity at an alarming rate. In order for Bitcoin’s price to rise, albeit slowly but steadily, the difficulty of mining (hash rate) has to increase. Currently, we can see a huge price drop which does not pose a security risk per se but prevents BTC price to go back up.</p>
<h2>2.Purchase of Bitcoin by Grayscale</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_2_7_obr_2_8ebe877886.png" alt="Grayscale flows chart">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Grayscale BTC purchasing flow</span>
<p>After the halving in May 2020, the rule was that the institution bought more Bitcoins per month than it was actually being mined. However, this ended in February. As you can see, Grayscale has not been purchasing Bitcoin since then. Why? Because the institutions' interest in Bitcoin has declined. What we can see even at this moment is that they are not stocking up on Bitcoin even at the current market price. Grayscale is an important player and in order for Bitcoin’s price to rise, we need big institutions to buy Bitcoin again.</p>
<h2>3. Bitcoin on exchanges</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_2_7_obr_3_ba3499d59f.png" alt="Percentage of BTC on exchanges">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 3: Percentage of BTC on exchanges</span>
<p>Another thing that has changed negatively, is Bitcoins on the stock exchanges. We see that after the COVID pandemic breakout, the volume of bitcoins on exchanges started to decline in large numbers. This means that both “hodlers” and big institutions started withdrawing their bitcoin savings.  The fewer Bitcoins on the stock exchanges, the greater the pressure on the purchase price. However, this has also changed with the recent price plunge. In terms of price, we would need Bitcoins to move out of the exchanges again which would cause their shortage there. That is due to the fact that the potential Bitcoin shortage on exchanges would cause institutions to look for other ways of buying Bitcoin which would then push its price up.</p>
<h2>4. Active addresses</h2>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_2_7_obr_4_b022c19052.png" alt="number of active BTC addresses">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 4: Number of active BTC addresses</span>
<p>The number of active addresses has also dropped recently. What this indicator shows us is the involvement of traditional retail traders. If the interest in cryptocurrencies is great and new people are coming to the cryptocurrency market, new addresses are also added. However, if the interest in cryptocurrencies is somewhat lukewarm, then no new addresses are being added. This is certainly not a crucial metric, but it certainly helps us to see the bigger picture.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this article, we have looked at the analysis of Bitcoin from a bit different perspective. We see that something has changed in the on-chain data as well, and the results are not the same. I have also shown you the important metrics that I am tracking and that need to change in order for Bitcoin to start growing again.</p>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: CoinMarketCap cooperation with the decentralized exchange Uniswap</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>CoinMarketCap traffic is constantly growing</h2>
<p>CoinMarketCap was founded in 2013 and since then it has become one of the most preferred websites with crypto data in the world. In 2019, the platform also introduced its own crypto indices on major financial platforms, such as the Nasdaq Global Index Data Service and Bloomberg Terminal. For many, this is a portal where they can relatively <strong>easy find all the necessary information about individual cryptocurrencies, exchanges and various other analytical data.</strong>
 In addition, since the beginning of this year, they have seen a huge increase in traffic, which increased from 101 million in January to an incredible 270 million in May. The vast majority of visits are brought to them by the most famous exchange Binance which is responsible for 53% of traffic.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/coinmarketcap_website_home_page_74ad9def67.jpg" alt="CoinMarketCap website home page">
<span class="img-caption">CoinMarketCap website home page, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>Not everyone knows that <strong>CoinMarketCap is actually owned by Binance itself.</strong>
 However, according to public statements, CMC was about to gain operational independence from Binance. Nevertheless, some of the leading representatives of CoinMarketCap left after the takeover of the portal, and therefore the alleged independence from the well-known exchange remains the subject of various speculations.</p>
<p><strong>The CoinMarketCap offer expanded with a decentralized token exchange</strong>
</p>
<p>The good news is that despite the excellent results, the leaders have not rested on their laurels and are constantly working on improvements and new functionality. According to the latest information a <strong>new token swap feature has appeared on the analytics website</strong>
 and allows users to exchange cryptocurrencies directly within the platform. The service is brought <strong>in cooperation with the most famous decentralized exchange Uniswap</strong>
 and the offer currently applies to ERC-20 tokens of Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>It is interesting that CMC preferred Uniswap in this cooperation, over a decentralized exchange from their own chain - PancakeSwap. According to Dune Analytics, <strong>Uniswap is currently the most popular decentralized exchange in the world,</strong>
 with an overall market share of over 68%. CMC officials indicated that further integrations with other decentralized exchanges and other available chains may take place in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Although it is a DeFi solution, it should be as simple as possible for users</strong>
</p>
<p>CMC announced that electronic wallets supported by Uniswap will be available for tokens swap. These are MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, Fortmatic and Portis. To perform the exchange itself, the user must click on the CMC page of the supported token, where the option "Swap on CoinMarketCap" will appear on the right side. When clicked, users will see tokens available for exchange (swap), as well as a prompt to connect an electronic wallet.</p>
<p><strong>This news is, of course great, especially for the Uniswap exchange,</strong>
 as the cooperation with CMC is likely to bring them millions of new users and <strong>also for the entire DeFi industry.</strong>
 According to CryptoFees, Uniswap v3 has generated an average of $ 1.7 million in daily fees over the past week, and Uniswap v2 has generated an average of about $ 1.2 million per day. So together they generate more fees than Bitcoin and Binance Smart Chain combined.</p>

<Title>Crude Oil (WTI) statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.76%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.96%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.92%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.93%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>-0.09%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently negative (<strong>-2</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-2</strong>
 for price indexation. Therefore, it is currently in the negative phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. As we can see in the chart below, all <strong>WTI</strong>
 MAs are still in bullish sentiment. In the event of a decline, the monthly MA can be an important support for the price of oil.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, we have witnessed more upward trends, the maximum level of which has reached <strong>7</strong>
 consecutive days. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>4</strong>
 days in the same period. However, the maximum decrease was <strong>11</strong>
 days in the measured period. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.37%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.75%</strong>
, which only confirms the recent decline in True Range. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.6%</strong>
 and <strong>3.6%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>6.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210702_LH_0ad5194b4b.jpg" alt="WTI daily low to high distribution">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still points to the positive sentiment, as the price creates higher highs and higher lows. The <strong>WTI</strong>
 is currently very close to the medium-term highs created in <strong>2018</strong>
. This level of around <strong>77.00</strong>
 could be important not only for bulls. However, rising inflation could raise the price above the psychological level of <strong>80.00</strong>
. The market price is far from both moving averages, which could motivate bears. This scenario also supports the divergence between price development and RSI, which has developed in recent weeks. If there is a further decline, the next stop could be the demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
, along with the psychological level of <strong>60.00</strong>
.</p>

<Title>Binance solves problems with regulators all over the world</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Even the biggest players on the market can have problems</h2>
<p>Binance is one of the most famous crypto exchanges and offers its services to millions of customers around the world. However, <strong>regulatory frameworks appear to have been significantly underestimated in some countries.</strong>
 Regulators in individual jurisdictions, therefore, call on them to provide explanations, but they also investigate the company and its activities. The large countries - <strong>the United Kingdom, USA, Japan, Canada and Germany,</strong>
 which have reservations about Binance's business - are now being joined by others - <strong>Singapore, Thailand and the Cayman Islands.</strong>
 There are problems with regulations on the well-known exchange, which is one of the most complicated aspects of this type of business.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/Binance_logo_3_D_illustration_0a3b3c843a.jpg" alt="Binance logo 3D illustration">
<span class="img-caption">Binance logo 3D illustration, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>Late last week, the <strong>UK Finance Office</strong>
 said Binance Markets Limited was banned from operating in the country. They also shed light on Binance's activities in <strong>Japan</strong>
, and their FCA warned that the company was not officially registered in the country. <strong>Malaysia's Securities and Exchange Commission</strong>
 has added that Binance operates illegally in the country.</p>
<h2>Countries and governments do not like the fact that the Binance exchange ignores the legislation</h2>
<p><strong>The Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA)</strong>
 has stated that Binance is not authorized to conduct business in their jurisdiction. They mentioned Binance, Binance Group and Binance Holdings Limited and added that none of them was registered, licensed, regulated and otherwise authorized to operate as a crypto exchange from the Cayman Islands. These companies are thus currently being investigated and it is being examined whether they fall within the scope of the regulatory supervision of the Office. CIMA stated that any company based in the Cayman Islands that provides virtual asset services on or from the island must be licensed in accordance with the virtual asset regulations, or an exemption from CIMA.</p>
<p>However, Binance's problems are far from over, and the <strong>Thai SEC has filed a criminal complaint against the company,</strong>
 initiating criminal proceedings and an investigation into the alleged operation of the digital assets business without a license. They claim that Binance, through its Facebook page (Binance Thai Community), called on the Thai public and investors to use their services. The SEC said they sent a warning letter to Binance in April, requesting Binance to comment on the facts, but did not receive a response.</p>
<h2>The problems of one represent an ideal opportunity for another</h2>
<p>Reports of regulators' interventions against Binance are coming from all over the world, and it will certainly be interesting to see how the company copes with these inconveniences. Binance is known for having <strong>many different entities around the world.</strong>
 It has been said for some time that their headquarters are in Malta, but this information has also been refuted and the Maltese Financial Services Authority has confirmed that it has never approved Binance's operations in the country.</p>
<p>Given all the above facts and the number of countries that are investigating the activities of the well-known exchange, it is a huge advantage for them to have the <strong>best teams of lawyers and experts on this issue.</strong>
 However, even they do not have to guarantee of a victorious end of these regulatory battles, and Binance could lose profits from many of the jurisdictions in which they currently operate. <strong>On the other hand, it opens up an opportunity for other crypto exchanges,</strong>
 which have been thinking about regulatory frameworks since their inception.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>In recent days, the list of countries that have a problem with the operation of the Binance exchange has expanded again. The cause of the intervention of regulators are missing licenses.</Excerpt>

<Title>USD/CHF statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.46%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.48%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.23%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.24%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was only <strong>0.15%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently very positive (<strong>3</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we estimate the last growth phase of the cycle. Indexation is specifically at its extreme. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this year, there have been more downward trends, where we recorded a maximum of <strong>4</strong>
 consecutive days. The highest decline in the measured period was <strong>9</strong>
 days. However, upward trends dominated in the recent weeks. The maximum growth was in the measured period of <strong>5</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.66%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.49%</strong>

 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.00%</strong>
 and <strong>1.00%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis supports the bullish sentiment after the dynamic upward movement in mid-June. However, we clearly see the divergence between the market price and the RSI that has been forming since the beginning of April. Volumes slow down from the last peak (red ellipse). All moving averages are below the exchange rate and could act as support in the event of a downturn. There is also a strong demand zone (green rectangle). <strong>USD/CHF</strong>
 is currently close to the support line of <strong>0.9210</strong>
 (blue line) and the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>38.20%</strong>
.</p>

<Excerpt>The current price of the USD/CHF exchange rate is 0.9244 (July 06, 2021). The pair has rebounded dynamically since our last analysis. The US Dollar strengthened at most exchange rates. Let us therefore now turn to statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>Investro Tea: Week #27</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Bezos has officially stepped down from his position as CEO of Amazon. He decided to do so at the age of 57, with overall net worth exceeding 200 billion dollars. Just recently he bought a new yacht for approximately 500 million dollars. His new plans now are to concentrate on Blue Origins, which should soon launch to space. Therefore, his free time is probably going to be very interesting combination of relax and work on new projects.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/Investro_Tea_27_f48c73ba5f.png" alt="Jeff Bezos and Blue Origin ">
<span class="img-caption">Jeff Bezos ends as a CEO of Amazon and is now planning to go to space, Source: Blue Origin</span>
<p>However, Richard Branson decided, that the attempt by Bezos to fly to space, will be put into the shadow of his own flight. Branson decided to fly to space with his company Virgin Galactic 9 days before Bezos. The date is now set for 11th of July. In previous Investro Tea we mentioned that there seems to be a new "space-flights-war" that is ongoing between the billionaires, and it seems like we were right.</p>
<p>Yet, not everyone can afford to fly to space. Ordinary people in USA are having problems with simple driving, since the prices of crude oil are getting more expensive. The prices of the crude oil are on its 6-year highs. Since these are pretty important news, our analysts have decided to look more closely on what is happening with crude oil <a href="https://investro.com/commodities/crude-oil-wti-statistical-and-technical-analysis-2">in this analysis</a>
.</p>
<p>Since we mentioned both, flying and driving, look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zomcXYwHrQk">this news coming from Slovakia</a>
, where we witnessed first intercity flight of a car. Do you think that flying cars are the future?</p>
<h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>
<p>As always, we have spend considerable time on cryptocurrencies as well this week. For instance, <a href="https://investro.com/crypto/de-fi-sunday-coin-market-cap-cooperation-with-the-decentralized-exchange-uniswap-1">we have informed about CoinMarektCap,</a>
 which now allows for cryptocurrency trading directly on its platform thanks to the partnership with a decentralized exchange Uniswap.</p>
<p>On the other hand, less optimistic news were seen by Binance, which is now facing problems from regulators all over the world. The approach of this exchange to these problems was summarised in <a href="https://investro.com/crypto/binance-solves-problems-with-regulators-all-over-the-world">this article</a>

<Title>Technical analysis of gold: What to expect in upcoming days and weeks?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>From looking at the daily chart, I still believe that the next few months might not lead to any serious price movement. We are still far away from the upward trendline resistance, and the support zone is currently very strong. I therefore believe that in coming weeks, gold will mostly go sideways. These two facts are the most crucial ones to have in mind in the near future. We can only talk about next new trend only when gold breaks above the trendline or below the support. The former would mean a bullmarket on gold, whereas the latter would indicate a bear market. Any movement between these two zones can therefore only be considered a sideways price movement.</p>
<p>In this zone we can see different up and down movements, however, until we break either level, we are not likely to see any change in the trend.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Long term analysis of gold, Source: Author</span>
<h2>4H chart</h2>
<p>As promised, we will also look at 4hour chart. If you are looking for a long term entrance, this might not be the best opportunity for you. The ideal case would be to buy on the support for the cheapest buy entry, or in case of a breakout of the trendline, buying on a clear change of trend. However, if you are looking from trading, 4H chart might give you a bit more room for action.</p>
<p>With regards to 4h chart, I currently believe we have reached our top and a bit of retracement should follow, probably to the levels around 1790 USD. From here I am expecting a move upwards probably to levels around 1844 - 1851 USD. From this point of view I therefore believe that we can test the long term trend line resistance in the coming days or weeks.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Short term analysis of gold, Source: Author</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Right now, most of the markets are pretty boring, which is also a case of gold. Moreover, summer is coming, which is usually a bit weaker when it comes to volumes and most of the assets will probably move sideways. That means that the movements are usually not strong enough to influence a change in trend in any direction and this now applies also to gold.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>In todays analysis we will be looking more closely at gold. We will not only look at the daily chart, but also at long term trend. However, to satisfy the needs of all traders, I will also look at the short term timeframes and will provide technical analysis for upcoming few days.</Excerpt>

<Title>The fundament of the week: Stablecoins</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>How stablecoin is created and what it is used for</h2>
<p>Undoubtedly, the typical characteristic of cryptocurrencies is volatility. Upward and downward price movements ranging anywhere from percent to tens of percent are nothing special for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This aspect makes cryptocurrencies an attractive opportunity for speculation, but it also limits the possibility of their wider usage in the financial market.</p>
<p>To ensure at least partial market stability, it was necessary to come up with a solution whose exchange rate would be fixed on more stable fiat currencies or commodities. And so stablecoins were born. Unlike classical cryptocurrencies, their supply is usually backed by existing commodities. It ensures their stability and direct correlation with the bound commodity. In the vast majority of cases, the US dollar plays the role of the main backing cryptocurrency. Therefore, the price of one stablecoin usually corresponds to the price of one dollar.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that the value of stable cryptocurrencies is not prone to such high volatility, it serves as an ideal connection between classic fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. Through them, it is possible to invest in cryptocurrencies without fear of devaluing the invested funds within a few days or even hours.</p>
<h2>What are stablecoins backed with?</h2>
<p>The mentioned backing up of stablecoins by another commodity is somewhat simplistic. In practice, <strong>there are 3 basic groups of stablecoins:</strong>
</p>
<li>Collateralized (backed) by fiat currencies and commodities</li>
<li>Collateralized by other cryptocurrencies</li>
<li>Uncollateralized</li>
<h3>Collateralized by fiat currencies or commodities</h3>
<p>By far the most popular is the simplest way to hedge currency - collateralization through the classic fiat currency or commodity. To successfully create a coin, you need to deposit the corresponding pegging currency/commodity (dollar, euro, yen, gold, silver, oil) into a tied bank account. It is possible to exchange between fiat and cryptocurrency in this way without much difficulty. This raises the aforementioned bridge between the two currency worlds. Whether this idea is in line with the first postulate of cryptocurrencies - decentralization - will be left up for discussion.</p>
<h3>Collateralized by cryptocurrency</h3>
<p>It may not be clear to you now how stablecoin can be collateralized by a cryptocurrency that is highly volatile. It is quite simple. Many companies are trying to deal with the massive movements of their projects by buying stablecoins and counterbalancing cryptocurrency at twice the value. So they will get a one-dollar worth of stablecoin for $ 2 worth of crypto. The main problem remains the high cost of this solution and the inevitable centralization of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<h3>Uncollateralized stablecoins</h3>
<p>Everything is possible in the 21st century, so it is not surprising that stablecoins can be formed without being pegged to any commodity or fiat/cryptocurrency. Special algorithms are used to calculate and maintain their value. Through them, the supply of stablecoins changes according to the fluctuation of the commodity to which it is virtually linked. This solution helps to partially solve the problem of insufficient decentralization because it works on the principle of smart contracts.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Comparative analysis of stablecoins</span>
<h2>Stablecoins are everywhere you look</h2>
<p>In recent years, there has been an influx of various stablecoins on the market. In addition to enthusiasts who are trying to resolve the biggest pain of the cryptomarket, banks and other financial institutions are trying to come up with their own solution too. Undoubtedly, they are attracted by the idea of establishing a functional system and gaining an access to a massive market with a large number of active investors through a functional system.</p>
<h2>Stablecoins and controversies</h2>
<p>Despite all the positives and their stability aspect, it cannot be said that stablecoins avoid controversy more than other projects. Probably the biggest focus in this field has been the stablecoin that currently comes in fourth in the terms of market capitalization - Tether. A study published in 2018 confirmed that the USDT was used to manipulate cryptocurrency prices during the massive growth in 2017. Throughout the same year, it was also speculated whether Tether had sufficient reserves in the accounts to cover all coins issued. The company behind Tether did not provide any guarantees to rebut this allegation and continued to "mint" new coins.</p>
<p>Several failed projects that were not able to fulfill their ambitions are also worth mentioning. For example, NuBits. At the end of 2018, a similar fate befell the project of the uncollateralized stablecoin Basis, which justified the termination of its activities by doubts about the forthcoming regulations by the American authorities.</p>
<h2>What is the likely future of stablecoins?</h2>
<p>Let's try looking into the future now. What fate awaits stablecoins? Due to the planned cryptocurrency regulatory measures by governments and control institutions, stablecoins can be expected to become an inevitable solution. Their ability to maintain value even in turbulent times will certainly be appreciated by many large investors, as evidenced by the involvement of large banks and their announced plans of creating their own currencies.</p>
<p>The mass spread of stablecoins can ultimately serve as a bridge for the subsequent development of cryptocurrencies. In an increasingly globalized world, stablecoins will serve as a universal currency, avoiding unnecessary fees for exchanging fiat currencies in traditional exchange offices or for transferring funds as part of international payments.</p>

<Excerpt>Tether, TrueUSD, Dai, and many more. You probably know that these are the so-called Stablecoins. But do you have at least a basic idea of what these specific cryptocurrencies are for? This will be the topic for today’s article.</Excerpt>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Bitcoin broke the channel - Will dominance follow?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Bitcoin analysis</h2>
<p>Hodlers probably do not have many reason to smile, because the price of Bitcoin is barely moving. Long term hodlers might not care, because they should be in profit anyways. However, if someone decided to HODL long term in this year, he might be not having the best time, because it is very probable that his Bitcoin holdings are in red. This is however nothing unusual, because these phases of market cycle are normal. Since there is no clear trend for Bitcoin, long term holding might be "pushed" aside and trading can step in. What does Bitcoin 4h chart look like now?</p>
<h2>4h chart</h2>
<p>We have been holding this channel for quite some time. To be honest, I believed that we will break it upwards. However, I also made it clear that if we get close to downside trendline, it might get really bad. Bitcoin tried several times to break it downwards, but all the different tries were not successful. Yet, yesterday morning we got close to the downside trendline and the movement was almost immediately decided.</p>
<p>The trendline was broken and the channel broke down. As a support I now see the zone of 30 724 - 31 080 USD. In this moment we are testing the trendline from the downside, but I do not think we can get back to the channel.</p>

<span class="img-caption">4h chart of Bitcoin, Source: Author</span>
<h2>Bitcoin dominance</h2>
<p>We also should look at Bitcoin dominance. If you look at the chart of BTC and chart of BTC dominance, they look pretty similar, but dominance is a bit lagging. Bitcoin right now broke similar channel downwards, which might be also a chance for Bitcoin dominance. But first, I am expecting an upward movement as shown in the chart. In that case, the dotted line can be the first resistance. If Bitcoin dominance broke that resistance, the red support might possibly be the next one. On the other hand, if the resistance holds it can send us back to test the big rising channel. In case of downward breakout, altcoins can have more room to grow.</p>

<Excerpt>Bitcoin has not moved much in past couple of weeks. If a complete beginner was looking at the Bitcoin price, he might even say, that the price is completely stagnating. Since Bitcoin does not have a clear trend now and its moving mostly to the side, we have to adjust our trading to it.</Excerpt>

<Title>XPD/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.47%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.53%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.75%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.70%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>0.13%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. It is currently in the extreme growth phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. The price of <strong>XPD/USD</strong>
 has strengthened over the last month. Therefore, all MAs still support bullish sentiment. The monthly MA could be an important support if the price falls.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>After our analysis, we have witnessed more declining trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>5</strong>
 consecutive days. The total maximum in the measured period (last 3 years) is the same. The upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. However, the maximum in the measured period is <strong>14</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.29%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.09%</strong>
, which is below the average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.0%</strong>
 and <strong>3.0%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>5.25%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to volatile development since the beginning of this year. The medium-term correction was replaced by short-term growth. <strong>XPD/USD</strong>
 is currently very close to the short-term moving average, which could be an important price support. In addition, it is also located in the demand zone (green rectangle), where is the psychological level of <strong>2 750</strong>
. However, the divergence between the price development and the RSI could support the opposite scenario.</p>

<Excerpt>The current price of XPD/USD - Palladium Spot US Dollar is 2 809.3 (July 09, 2021). The market price of this commodity has fallen dynamically in the last month. However, it is trading again at pre-decline levels. Let us therefore now turn to statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: Communication between blockchains is key for the industry</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Technologies are gradually changing the world's financial markets for better</h2>
<p>Many may not realize this, but we are living in a time full of changes and innovations in global finances. Traditional finances, with their cumbersome and outdated systems, can hardly compete with ultra-modern technologies. It is <strong>cryptocurrencies that represent one of the most developed ecosystems</strong>
 in the financial market, despite the fact that the global economy has so far made very little use of their potential.</p>
<p>However, the level of involvement of cryptocurrencies and blockchain solutions is growing at a tremendous pace, and according to analysts, it is only a matter of time before the industry shows its true potential. Thousands of different cryptocurrencies compete for market share with their solutions, on various blockchains. This also brings a problem in the form that <strong>individual blockchains cannot communicate with each other.</strong>
 This highlights the need for projects and companies that build <strong>cross-chain bridges</strong>
. These bring links between the individual chains and are especially important for the dynamic DeFi industry.</p>
<h2>The DeFi industry is an accelerator in the development of cross-chain solutions worldwide</h2>
<p>It is important to note that various cross-chain solutions have started to appear on the market mainly due to decentralized finances, and these are the main drivers of this development. <strong>DeFi largely challenges the functioning of traditional finances</strong>
 with a centralized nature and creates ecosystems in which everyone has access to decentralized financial services. In addition, it ideally completely eliminates interactions with third parties - such as banks.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/global_defi_network_cryptocurrency_blockchain_and_iot_b28e28ca2e.jpg" alt="Global DeFi network - Cryptocurrency, blockchain and IoT">
<span class="img-caption">Global DeFi network - Cryptocurrency, blockchain and IoT, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>Decentralized crypto exchanges (DEX) are definitely one of the most well-known DeFi solutions. Leading decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap are already competing for the largest centralized exchanges. This massive adoption of decentralized technologies clearly shows us the future development of the market.</p>
<p>Most DeFi protocols initially worked on the Ethereum blockchain, which meant that users were limited to the capabilities of this platform. <strong>Cross-chain solutions significantly change this situation and allow DeFi projects to interact with multiple blockchain ecosystems</strong>
 through bridges. For example, a project based on the Ethereum blockchain can also provide its services at Binance Smart Chain. This significantly reduces costs and increases the possibilities of use for DeFi users.</p>
<h2>Thanks to DeFi, the possibilities of using cryptocurrencies are growing exponentially</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency market can still be considered relatively young, but in a few years of its operation, it has moved significantly forward. <strong>From building systems for fast and secure transactions, we have moved to a whole new type of decentralized financial services.</strong>
 In addition, the degree of innovation of these projects attracts more and more investors to DeFi and also huge amounts of capital, which are further supporting the industry and development.</p>
<p>Thanks to a number of new investments, the <strong>DeFi industry has grown more than 50 times in the last two years,</strong>
 and its total market capitalization is approaching $ 80 billion. This currently represents around 5% of the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies, and many believe that this growth will continue. The assumption also confirms that investors and retail are beginning to understand the potential of the DeFi industry and, in particular, the huge added value it brings to its users.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Financial markets are experiencing a really turbulent period, marked by a number of innovations in the form of cryptocurrencies, blockchain and the entire DeFi industry. However, the fact that cryptocurrencies operate on different blockchains is a challenge that needs to be solved.</Excerpt>

<Title>More than $ 1 billion has been spent on VISA crypto cards</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>VISA feels at home in the crypto sector</h2>
<p>The multinational company VISA announced through an official statement that its payment cards supporting cryptocurrencies recorded <strong>expenses in excess of $ 1 billion in the first half of 2021.</strong>
 To a large extent, this dispels various misconceptions that cryptocurrencies are not good currency and that no one wants to pay with them. VISA clearly feels at home in the cryptocurrency sector, and decisions in favour of working with crypto companies have clearly paid to them. The company noted that it has <strong>partnered with 50 major companies in the crypto industry</strong>
 and allowed their users to convert and spend digital currencies at 70 million merchants worldwide.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/visa_crypto_linked_payment_card_e9b69cf38c.jpg" alt="VISA crypto-linked payment card">
<span class="img-caption">VISA crypto-linked payment card, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>Given the report and the volume of spending mentioned, it is clear that the cryptocurrency <strong>community sees value in linking digital assets to the VISA global payment network.</strong>
 The company was not very optimistic about crypto-linked cards and estimated that they would record much fewer expenses. They also consider it a great advantage of the whole system that it does not require global merchants to accept cryptocurrencies directly. VISA has been cooperating with a number of companies for a long time, and the most well-known from the crypto world certainly include Crypto.com, FTX, Coinbase, CoinZoom and many others.</p>
<h2>We will use cryptocurrencies like any regular FIAT currency</h2>
<p><strong>They see great added value, for example, in stablecoins</strong>
 - cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of other assets, or FIAT currencies. According to VISA, stablecoins are relatively <strong>close to fulfilling the idea of a fully digital FIAT.</strong>
 They added that stablecoins are well on their way to becoming an important part of the wider digital transformation of financial services, and VISA is excited to help shape and support this development. The company is working intensively on strategies to connect cryptocurrencies to their network so as to bring added value to all forms of money transfers.</p>
<p>CFO Vasant Prabhu said they were doing everything they could to create an <strong>ecosystem that would make cryptocurrencies usable, such as any common FIAT currency.</strong>
 In addition, they add various loyalty programs to these solutions, which they bring from the "old school". For example, they allow users to spend FIAT and obtain cryptocurrencies. It is good to understand that VISA, together with its partners, is building completely new ecosystems, which may in the future be the <strong>cornerstones of an economy based on blockchain and decentralization.</strong>

<h2>For the time being, VISA and other payment companies are only warming up in the crypto area</h2>
<p>The global giant recorded a total volume of almost $ 38 billion in processed transactions in the first quarter of 2021. This clearly shows that <strong>cryptocurrencies are so far only a side business for VISA</strong>
 in terms of revenue. Prabhu said <strong>they do not plan to add any cryptocurrencies to their portfolio</strong>
 and they will not follow companies such as Tesla, MicroStrategy and others. Many argue that adoption by large companies is healthy for cryptocurrencies. However, long-standing advocates of cryptocurrencies believe that these companies are deeply rooted in traditional banking systems and are forcing crypto projects to compromise against their decentralized nature.</p>
<p>Of course, the market is also being examined by the competition that for VISA represents mainly MasterCard. It was this company that recently found in its survey that up to 93% of North American consumers plan to use cryptocurrencies or other new payment technology next year, and 75% of millennials would use cryptocurrencies if they understood them better. The goal of <strong>MasterCard, in cooperation with the Gemini crypto exchange, is to launch its own crypto-linked payment card.</strong>

<Title>USD/CAD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.41%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.41%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.20%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.20%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was only <strong>0.10%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently very positive (<strong>3</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the last extreme positive phase of the cycle according to the indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210713_Cycles_98cd0fb577.jpg" alt="USD/CAD daily price indexation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to the short-term and medium-term MAs, <strong>USD/CAD</strong>
 is finally in bullish sentiment. In the event of further growth, the annual MA could be an important resistance for the exchange rate.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210713_Mo_M_765708c87e.jpg" alt="USD/CAD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>There have been more upward trends since our last analysis, with a maximum of <strong>3</strong>
 days. The maximum in the measured period is <strong>7</strong>
 days. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>1</strong>
 day in the same period. However, the maximum in the measured period is <strong>5</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.68%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.70%</strong>
, which is almost the same. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-0.90%</strong>
 and <strong>0.90%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.40%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis supports short-term bullish sentiment. In the long run, the exchange rate is still on a declining trend. We also see clear divergence between the market price of <strong>USD/CAD</strong>
 and the RSI that have arisen over the last <strong>3</strong>
 months. In addition, the market price is in the supply zone (red rectangle), where are also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
, the psychological level of <strong>1.2600</strong>
 and currently also the long-term moving average. In the case of further growth above the zone, the psychological level of <strong>1.3000</strong>
 could be an important resistance. If the pair corrects, <strong>1.2300</strong>
 could be support.</p>

<Excerpt>The current price of the USD/CAD exchange rate is 1.2528 (July 13, 2021). This pair rebounded upwards, as we estimated in our last analysis. It is currently testing an important level of resistance after recent growth. Let us therefore look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>Investro Tea: Week #28</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The world pandemic seems to be slowing down thanks to vaccination efforts, yet, the third wave might becoming shortly due to Delta variant. Nevertheless the world economy seems to be getting back in shape. Generally, the pandemic has significantly affected almost all industries, but the biggest hits were seen mainly across tourism, hospitality and logistics. Due to this, and constant money printing that we can see now, inflation is rising. Some of the expectations of future inflation are really frightening and there are even analysts forecasting a long period of significant inflation.</p>
<h2>Various market news</h2>
<p>Microsoft, one of the biggest IT giants, has decided to buy a cybersecurity startup RiskIQ. This company is mainly focused on safety of softwares and protection from activities of hackers. This deal was announced on Monday and it seems that Microsoft has agreed to pay 500 million dollars for the acquisition.</p>
<p>Microsoft is not the only huge company that is looking at new business opportunities. Only a while ago Walmart created a startup called Flipkart, which is mostly focused on e-commerce in India. According to the current news this new startup is now valued at around 37 million dollars and its attracting more and more attention from investors, such as Japanese SoftBank Group Corp. It is even planning to go public in the future, which already shows its potential and ambitions.</p>
<p>Not every company is having such a great time though. TikTok, which is a new social network used mostly by young millenials and Gen Z, has to postpone its IPO. This is connected to the announcement of Chinese regulators, who warned against possible data breaches from the platform. Due to this, TikTok has decided to wait with its IPO until this settles down. In November the company was valued at approximately 180 billion dollars.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency market is rather stagnant right now, but that does not mean that you should forget about it. For instance, we have decided to use this time to educate our readers about Stablecoins, which we have explained in our latest Fundament of the week article. If you want to know more about this, usually, fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies, <a href="https://investro.com/crypto/the-fundament-of-the-week-stablecoins">follow this link</a>
.</p>
<p>We have also looked at some news that are connected to the cryptocurrency market. What stood out this week was the news about VISA and its cryptocurrency volume.  According to the latest release from VISA, more than 1 billion dollars worth of cryptocurrencies was transacted during first half of this year on the network. Compared to its normal volumes it is obviously not that significant, however, it only shows that cryptocurrencies are being used as a payment networks more often than before. This only helps the adoption of cryptocurrencies, which is why we have informed more about this <a href="https://investro.com/crypto/more-than-1-billion-has-been-spent-on-visa-crypto-cards">in the following article</a>
.</p>

<Excerpt>Last week was full of sport events. Novak Djokovic won his 20th Grand Slam title, Wimbledon, and we have also seen the final of EURO 2020, where Italy beat England after penalty shootout. Yet, the investing world was full of different events as well.</Excerpt>

<Title>Is DXY pointing at the weakness of the markets?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>DXY - The dollar index</h2>
<p>DXY, also known as the dollar index is an indicator portraying the strength of the US dollar. A rule of a thumb is that if this index is rising, the other markets are falling and vice versa. The stronger this index is, the weaker the other markets are. If we look at the weekly chart we can see that after the Covid-19 outbreak this index was constantly falling. Now we can see that it is starting to form some kind of triangle formation.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/DXY_weekly_27d86e3955.png" alt="Dollar index - DXY - weekly chart">
<span class="img-caption">DXY weekly chart Technical analysis, Source: Author</span>
<p>If we zoom in on a daily chart, we can see that we are getting really close to the trend line. Upward breakout of this trendline would go hand in hand with a new High, which can potentially mean trend reversal. This option is very close from happening, which would mean that the falling of DXY index would stop after several months.</p>

<span class="img-caption">DXY 1D chart Technical analysis, Source: Author</span>
<h2>Dow Jones</h2>
<p>On the other hand, if we look at Dow Jones, after the Covid price slump, we saw an incredible rise, which was forming a rising wedge formation, that we fell out of. Even though the price fell out of the wedge, DJI was able to create a new High, which however is not that significant.</p>
<p>Yet, this chart looks more and more bearish, and it is highly possible that we can be expecting a downward movement. And if we account for DXY strengthening, we can be going into quite a dangerous territory for this major index.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Dow Jones Technical analysis, Source: Author</span>
<h2>S&P 500</h2>
<p>If we have a look at another very popular index, S&P 500, we can see that the situation looks fairly similar to DJI. However, unlike in the case of DJI, S&P 500 has not fall out of wedge yet. Even in the wedge formation we have seen some sharp sudden price movements (usually to the downside), but all of them were fairly quickly pushed back up. However, even in this case we can be at the end of the cycle, which could lead to a rather severe downward movement.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Bitcoin waiting for a decisive move</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Daily chart shows no news</h2>
<p>Having looked at daily chart, we can see that the main support at around 28 000 - 30 000 USD is holding on. This support is absolutely crucial if we want to continue in the bull run.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/17_7_BTC_1_D_da1a9d22a7.png" alt="Bitcoin one day chart analysis">
<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin 1D chart analysis, Source: Author</span>
<p>Bitcoin is still moving in bullish channel. Eventhough it looks like it is slowly losing ground, the overall structure is still bullish and any bounce from the support can prove that. The question, however, still remains, why the proper bounce is not coming? The answer is that the market is in rather boring phase.  After a significant rise for past few months, the situation changed and we are in a bit of a sideways movement.</p>
<p>This is also interesting due to the psychology. When we saw a sharp fall below 30 000 USD, almost everyone believed in quick retracement back and continuation of a bull run. However, now its more than 2 months ever since we saw the sharp fall and we are still seeing practically the same price levels. The only thing that changed is the perception of retail traders, who switched from believing we are in a bull market, to more thinking about bear market</p>
<p>#4H chart</p>
<p>If we look at a 4H chart, we can see that the chart has a space to fall more. For us to see any significant change one of these 2 scenarios would need to play out:</p>
<li>Bearish - fall below the aforementioned support and close a daily candle below it.</li>
<li>Bullish - break the channel upwards and make a new High. Then we could be talking about the break of the channel.</li>

<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin 4H chart analysis, Source: Author</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has not moved anywhere in the past few weeks, but this state cannot continue forever. What usually happens is that at the exact moment, when most of the retail traders start to short the market or stop trading, significant movement happens. The volatility index is also very close to its minimum values, which means that we can only assume that sharper movement is coming.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this year, the basic technical analysis has supported bearish sentiment as the price of the commodity is creating lower lows and lower highs. The long-term outlook is more positive. Yesterday, <strong>XPT/USD</strong>
 fell from an important area, where are the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
, the psychological level of <strong>1 150.00</strong>
 and the short-term moving average. This could be a strong resistance to price in the near future. In the event of a further decline, there is the demand zone (green rectangle) with the psychological level of <strong>1 000.00</strong>
 and the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>38.20%</strong>
. The divergence between price development and the RSI, together with the long-term moving average, supports the current short-term bullish sentiment.</p>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: An interesting situation on decentralized exchanges</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Messari data shows really interesting data</h2>
<p>In the second quarter of this year, it looked good with the cryptocurrency market, and in some metrics, new historical highs were even reached. Subsequently, however, <strong>the entire market cooled down</strong>
 considerably, and with it, of course, the decentralized finance protocols began to slow down. However, trading volumes of decentralized exchanges nevertheless reached <strong>$ 405 billion in the second quarter.</strong>
 This is an increase of 83% compared to the previous period.</p>
<p>More importantly, for the first time in history, <strong>DEX volumes have reached levels over 10% compared to centralized exchanges volumes.</strong>
 This metric clearly indicates the future trend, and decentralized exchanges will gradually "eat" their centralized competition.</p>
<h2>There is also a battle between decentralized solutions</h2>
<p>The growing interest in this type of anonymized cryptocurrency exchange makes this market a very dynamic and competitive environment. A good example of this is the <strong>competition between Uniswap and PancakeSwap,</strong>
 which operate on the Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum blockchain. In April alone, PancakeSwap finally managed to outperform its biggest competitor, Uniswap.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/defi_market_profit_concept_with_view_from_window_7d0696f38e.jpg" alt="DeFi market profit concept with a view from the big window">
<span class="img-caption">DeFi market profit concept with a view from the big window, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>However, they did not maintain the lead for long, and <strong>Uniswap took the lead again after the launch of the V3 protocol,</strong>
 which brought benefits especially to liquidity providers. By the end of June, Uniswap had managed to control up to 54 % of the weekly volume, which currently represents 40% of the total trading volume of DEX.</p>
<p>The aforementioned market decline was probably the <strong>hardest hit for the BSC blockchain,</strong>
 where the total locked value (TVL) fell from its peak by up to 50%. Binance thus faces another problem, which they certainly do not need in the current situation. Apparently, they are also losing the race with Ethereum for the top blockchain for decentralized finances. According to experts, BSC can be a <strong>victim of short-term thinking,</strong>
 as users have been attracted to various benefits - simply - BCS was used to make quick money.</p>
<h2>Investors and traders should be wary of decentralized exchanges</h2>
<p>Many decentralized exchanges are doing extremely well and only a few days after launch are able to accumulate huge amounts of liquidity (total value locked - TVL). This happened, for example, at the <strong>ShibaSwap exchange,</strong>
 which rallied on the wave of popularity of Dogecoin (DOGE). They gain a TVL of $ 1 billion in one night, despite the fact that their protocol received a very low rating from independent quality assessors from DeFi Safety.</p>
<p>As a result, several security companies have begun to question the overall security and transparency of these platforms in recent weeks. Questions also arise as to <strong>whether these numbers are not being deliberately manipulated</strong>
 so that the platform will show a huge interest in its services.</p>

<Excerpt>These exchanges are the opposite of centralized solutions and provide the opportunity to trade without an intermediary. They seem to eat their home chains gradually.</Excerpt>

<Title>8 myths about cryptocurrencies that you should know</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>1. Cryptocurrencies are mainly used by criminals</h2>
<p>The worst thing about this myth is that in a way they are trying to label cryptocurrencies as something illegal, outlawed. This narrative is then passed on to individual users of cryptocurrencies. <strong>At the heart of this myth is the anonymity</strong>
 that digital assets can bring. However, this is only a matter of <strong>pseudo-anonymity.</strong>
</p>
<p>Anyone who has been involved in cryptocurrencies for more than a day knows that <strong>blockchain (on-chain) analysis can help identify criminals</strong>
 that make even one small mistake. Again, the media contribute to the construction of the myth, which often writes, for example, about various hacker attacks, and they do not forget to note that the attackers demand a ransom in Bitcoin. In fact, the US dollar is still the most widely used currency among criminals - so are we going to ban it?</p>
<h2>2. Cryptocurrencies and the environment</h2>
<p>We have already written about the effects of cryptocurrency mining, and the king of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, which works on Proof-of-Work mining, is most often mentioned in this regard. The topic began to be addressed especially after it was opened by Elon Musk and subsequently taken over by many other personalities and politicians.</p>
<p>However, according to surveys, <strong>up to 74% of the energy used in Bitcoin mining comes from renewable sources.</strong>
 Bitcoin, therefore, uses up to 3 times more renewable energy than we use in global consumption (26.2%). Miners are economically motivated to use the cheapest possible energy. In addition, the reduction of cryptocurrency mining in China, which mainly used energy from coal power plants, will also contribute to greener Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>3. Governments may ban cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>We hear this extremely often. I would invest in cryptocurrencies, but what if governments ban them? Based on many headlines of various articles, we are not even surprised that people think it is really possible. Some countries are even trying to do that, and we have seen <strong>similar initiatives in India, Nigeria, Turkey and Russia,</strong>
 for example.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/cryptocurrency_ban_conceptual_e53d3e30e7.jpg" alt="Cryptocurrency ban conceptual">
<span class="img-caption">Cryptocurrency ban conceptual, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>The only problem with these plans is that <strong>it is not physically possible.</strong>
 As we have already explained, cryptocurrencies and blockchain are formed by nodes around the world. So what exactly would the government need to ban? China, which is literally a master of censorship of virtually anything, has been trying to ban cryptocurrencies since 2017. In fact, <strong>states can only complicate users' access to cryptocurrencies,</strong>
 through various regulations. The only way they could "shut down" cryptocurrencies would be to <strong>turn off the Internet around the world,</strong>
 but no one is likely to do that.</p>
<h2>4. Bitcoin is centralized and controlled by China</h2>
<p>This myth arose, because China historically had the largest share of hash rate, and we often encounter it to this day. It is also used as an argument in the debate on the decentralization of Bitcoin. However, we must be aware of the <strong>significant difference between the bitcoin network and the miners.</strong>
</p>
<p>The fact that most miners are located in one country does not mean that the whole network is centralized. There are <strong>more than 13,000 nodes in the world</strong>
 and this represents decentralization. In addition, the centralization of mining will also be significantly reduced through new regulations in China.</p>
<h2>5. Cryptocurrencies will make you a millionaire</h2>
<p>This is one of the most common myths, and many people begin with cryptocurrencies with this "plan". The <strong>concept is simple - you will find the "future Bitcoin", you will invest some money and in a relatively short time you will become rich.</strong>
 However, the reality is quite different. The main problem is that you will encounter articles about how someone got rich on cryptocurrencies quite often. However, nobody writes that another 100 or 1,000 people lost their money due to a bad investment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/excited_crypto_millionaire_a6a80915c4.jpg" alt="Excited crypto millionaire">
<span class="img-caption">Excited crypto millionaire, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>We are not saying that you cannot get rich thanks to cryptocurrencies, and there are many people who have managed to make millions in this way. But no one can guarantee you such success, and novices, in particular, should focus primarily on information gathering and education. There is one well-known rule - <strong>the more company entices you to become a millionaire thanks to their cryptocurrency, the greater the chance that you will actually lose your money.</strong>
</p>
<h2>6. You will earn the most from day trading</h2>
<p>You can often come across the claim that you will earn the most from cryptocurrencies if you focus on day trading. In reality, however, it is an <strong>extremely time-consuming and psychologically demanding activity.</strong>
 It could be said that this way of trading is a full-time job. The cryptocurrency market is still quite unpredictable and it is very challenging in day trading.</p>
<p>A large group of investors and <strong>traders prefer longer-term trading strategies.</strong>
 On a weekly or monthly basis, they can predict future market development much more accurately and increase their value more efficiently. Of course, you don't have to hold cryptocurrencies indefinitely even with this type of strategy. Traders to whom day trading does not bring the expected profit often slip into the next myth.</p>
<h2>7. It is not worthwhile without leverage trading</h2>
<p>Leveraged trading poses a significant risk in itself, and cryptocurrencies, with their volatility, do not help. Various platforms offer <strong>leverage trading up to 100x.</strong>
 With cryptocurrencies, whose prices can fluctuate by tens of percent a day, this is literally a <strong>recipe for losing your money in record time.</strong>
</p>
<p>Each ad will tell you that leveraging will multiply your profits. However, few of them pay attention to the other side of the coin and will not say that <strong>it will multiply your potential losses as well.</strong>
 Thus, most retail investors and traders often lose all their funds by liquidating the position.</p>
<h2>8. The cryptocurrency market is dominated by retail</h2>
<p>Many retail traders (ordinary people) think that the cryptocurrency market is dominated by the masses, they can even move prices. However, most of the traded volumes, especially for the largest cryptocurrencies, are large institutional investors, so-called whales. According to the survey, <strong>4% of the largest traders make up 85% of all market liquidity.</strong>
</p>
<p>It is precisely these investors and traders who <strong>essentially decide whether the market situation will be favourable or not.</strong>
 In addition, they can use their strong position to trade against the market and, to "play" with the retail. You can probably imagine how this fight turns out.</p>

<Title>Investro Tea: Week #29</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>3D printing technology has been with us for a decade and has been constantly improving since that time. At first, it seemed that only practical usage for which this technology would be sufficient enough for will be the printing of Dungeon and Dragons action figures or other rather decorative objects. However, contrary to all expectations the latest feat in this field is the 3D printing of large metal structures. If you find it hard to believe, below you can watch a video that will show you the production and installation of an already mentioned bridge in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>For more information, <a href="https://mx3d.com/industries/infrastructure/mx3d-bridge/">see the official website of MX3D</a>
.</p>
<p>The usefulness of 3D printing is also being manifested in healthcare. All of us probably remember 3D printers that were used to print protective face shields during the COVID pandemic. Thanks to its speed and efficiency, 3D printing has also been used for many years in the prosthetic production business. Before this technology came into use, It was very expensive to make a movable hand prosthesis for a child, for example, but thanks to 3D printing, people can make prostheses for their children from the comfort of their homes.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the 3D printing of children’s prostheses <a href="https://faithreel.org/kids-make-3d-printed-hands-for-kids-missing-limbs-cant-afford-them/">here</a>
.</p>
<p>What you will not be able to print at home is a 3D house from concrete, that specialized companies are focusing on currently. In the future, it is assumed that the technology of 3D printing of buildings could be used in the space program - for the Moon base construction. The material on the Moon would be regolith - lunar dust, of which there is an almost unlimited amount on the Moon.</p>
<p>In Denmark, they already live in 3D-printed buildings. In case you are wondering how does a 3D printed house look like and how is it like to live in it you can <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/apr/30/dutch-couple-move-into-europe-first-fully-3d-printed-house-eindhoven">read about it in this article by The Guardian</a>

<Title>AUD/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.54%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.57%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.28%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.27%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was <strong>-0.16%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>2</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>2</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the positive phase of the cycle in both scorings, which range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210721_Cycles_9048469397.jpg" alt="AUD/USD daily price indexation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to all MAs, <strong>AUD/USD</strong>
 is in a bearish sentiment because it is below them. In the event of growth, the monthly MA could be the first important resistance for the exchange rate.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210721_Mo_M_ae4ef5e905.jpg" alt="AUD/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, there have been more downward trends with a maximum of <strong>3</strong>
 consecutive days. However, the total maximum in the measured period is <strong>11</strong>
 days. The upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>4</strong>
 days in the same period with a maximum in the total measured period of <strong>7</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.96%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.78</strong>
%, which is almost an average value. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.2%</strong>
 and <strong>1.2%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.75%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports short-term bearish sentiment as the exchange rate creates lower lows and lower highs. This pair fell below an important psychological level of <strong>0.7600</strong>
 last month. It is currently also below the <strong>0.7400</strong>
 level, where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
. However, we can also clearly see the bullish divergence between the market price and the RSI. In the event of a further decline, the demand zone (green rectangle) with the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>38.20%</strong>
 and the psychological level of <strong>0.7000</strong>
 could be important for bulls.</p>

<Excerpt>The current price of the AUD/USD exchange rate is 0.7357 (July 21, 2021). It has dropped by more than 400 pips since our last analysis. The pair has also fallen below important level in recent days. So let’s move on to statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>Fundament of the week: Blockchain and AI as technologies of the future</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What is artificial inteligence (AI) ?</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence is the ability of a program to learn. It is also the science behind the engineering of intelligent computer programs. AI algorithms can understand patterns and solve problems with large data sets, all without human intervention. They analyze external input data, learn from them and use this knowledge to achieve specific goals by performing tasks.</p>
<p><strong>There are two main types of AI:</strong>
</p>
<li>Narrow AI</li>
<li>Strong AI</li>
<p><strong>Narrow AI</strong>
 focuses on specific or limited tasks, such as face recognition, spam filtering, or playing chess. Then there is <strong>strong AI</strong>
 that could manage to handle a wide range of tasks rather than one specific one. It could potentially have knowledge equal to that of humankind and would be able to complete any intellectual task that a human being could. Narrow AI exists today, while strong AI has yet to be created. Be that as it may, many experts wonder if it is even possible.</p>
<h2>A synergy of AI and blockchain technologies</h2>
<h3>Potential Blockchain improvement thanks to AI</h3>
<p>Mining requires a lot of computing power and energy. Distributed ledges sacrifice efficiency at the expense of features such as consistency and resistance to censorship. AI can be very effective in optimizing energy consumption, which could be useful in improving mining algorithms.</p>
<p>One of the main counter-arguments against the use of blockchain systems is extremely high energy consumption. The required crypto economic and security features introduce redundant computational tasks. Reduction of Proof of Work blockchains consumption would benefit the industry and support blockchains' normal uptake.</p>
<p>AI could also optimize blockchain storage needs. Because the transaction history is stored on all nodes, the size of a distributed ledger can quickly grow to large numbers. When storage requirements are high, the entry barrier is also higher, potentially reducing network decentralization. AI could introduce new database partitioning techniques that would reduce blockchain size and streamline data storage.</p>
<h3>Decentralized data economy</h3>
<p>Data is becoming an increasingly valuable commodity. Therefore, it must not only be stored safely but have the ability to be exchanged. Efficient AI systems are heavily dependent on data that blockchains can store with an extremely high degree of reliability.</p>
<p>Blockchain is basically a secure distributed database shared by all participants in the network. Its data is stored in blocks and each block is cryptographically linked to the previous one. This makes it incredibly difficult to modify stored information without trying to “kidnap” the consensus of the network. For example, through 51% of the attack.</p>
<p>Decentralized data exchange aims to create a new data economy, operating at the top of blockchains. These exchanges allow easy and secure access to data and storage for anyone (or anything). When connecting to this data economy, AI algorithms could use a larger set of external inputs and learn faster. In addition, the algorithms themselves could be replaced in these decentralized data markets. This would make them more accessible to a wider audience and could accelerate their development.</p>
<p>Decentralized data exchange has the potential to revolutionize data storage. In principle, anyone should be able to rent local storage for a fee (paid in tokens). Existing storage service providers, in turn, would need to improve their services to remain competitive.</p>
<h3>Decentralized supercomputers</h3>
<p>AI training requires not only quality data from which algorithms can learn but also immense computing power. AI algorithms often use a type of computer system known as an artificial neural network (ANN). ANN learns to perform tasks based on many examples. These ANNs often require a lot of computational power to go through millions of parameters to perform a given task.</p>
<p>If the data can be shared in a blockchain network, why not computing power? In some blockchain implementations, users can effectively lend the computing power of their machines in the peer-to-peer (P2P) market to those trying to perform complex calculations. In return, lending users are rewarded with tokens.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence systems could be trained on these computer platforms much more efficiently and at a reduced cost. While early use cases are primarily concerned with rendering 3D computer graphics, the focus may shift toward AI.</p>
<p>When developing these decentralized applications (DApps), companies that provide computing power may experience an influx of competition. Allowing users to earn revenue from renting their idle computing power will be used more efficiently. Theoretically, any currently idle processor or GPU in the world can be used for this purpose and act as a node in a decentralized supercomputer.</p>
<h3>Better audibility of AI decisions</h3>
<p>For humans, the decisions that AI systems make can be difficult to understand. These algorithms can work with such a large amount of data that it would be practically impossible for a person to perform an audit and replicate their decision-making process.</p>
<p>If decisions are recorded on the basis of each data point, there is a clear control trail for people who could check them. This could increase confidence in the decisions taken by AI algorithms.</p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>If these two technologies can fulfill their potential, they will undoubtedly have a lasting impact. While many companies use them separately, there are some interesting possible outcomes stemming from their combination.</p>
<p>As both technologies will evolve further, we will certainly discover other innovative ways to use blockchain technology with AI. The potential results are difficult to assess, but it is quite certain that they will lead to improvements in many aspects of our economy.</p>

<Excerpt>Many believe that the future of blockchain and AI is likely to be interconnected. Likewise, many people think it will be the most important technology of the coming decade. For this reason, it is important to take a closer look at how they can interact in the future.</Excerpt>

<Title>Technical Analysis of DXY and S&P 500</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>DXY</h2>
<p>The DXY has been declining for a long time until it finally sank to the bottom where it formed a triangle formation. DXY represents the strength of the US dollar. In general, we can say that as DXY rises, the dollar strengthens and classic markets, led by stocks and indices, fall. This rule has, of course, needs to be taken with a grain of salt as it does not apply to every single case.</p>
<p>We are currently in a situation where DXY attacks the upper limit of the triangle, but there it created another triangle.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/DXY_1_ae568e4b1d.png" alt="Technical analysis of DXY daily chart">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Technical analysis of DXY on D1 chart</span>
<h2>4H chart DXY</h2>
<p>We can see better in this chart that DXY created a wedge. So now, the question remains whether the collapse will come and if so, when it will happen. If a slump would come, it could again help the index, led by the S&P 500. However, if the price would overcome the trend on the daily chart and go up, it could mean problems for the indices.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/DXY_2_15fc745da1.png" alt="Technical analysis of DXY on a 4H chart">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Technical analysis of DXY on a 4H chart</span>
<h2>S&P 500</h2>
<p>In previous analyzes, I have already said that the S&P 500 is moving in the channel. This channel still seems unshaken, but it is a bearish channel and will not remain unshaken forever. However, the lower trend is still holding. As long as the S&P 500 stays in this channel, growth will continue. If you notice, it is still the same scenario. Whenever a quick decline on a trend line occurs a quick pull from there usually follows shortly after.</p>
<p>This index always miraculously rebounds and then seems to be bullish. The continuously growing price of DXY could lead to problems causing the price to fall downwards through the trend line.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/DXY_3_09c3f1e4f5.png" alt="Techical analysis of SP500 ">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 3: Technical analysis of SP500</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The indices are already quite upset. Dow Jones is even worse, as it is already showing signs of weakness. Growing DXY and similar patterns on the indices indicate a possible risk we should brace ourselves for.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Technical Analysis of Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>After almost 2 months, the decline seems to be finally coming to an end. From the bottom, the price is held by very strong support at the level of 30,000 USD, and from the top, it is pressed by the trend line. The space between these two levels is already minimal. Bitcoin has just approached the top trend line this week, and the situation now looks more bullish. A webinar, which was attended by Jack Dorsey and Elon Musk this week, may also have contributed to this situation. The topic of the webinar was Bitcoin. Overall, we heard very positive responses to the webinars addressed by Elon Musk, which could have contributed to the improvement of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>No significant changes can be spotted on the daily chart, but we know that the current decline is coming to an end. However, if we are looking for more visible movements we should take a look at the 4H chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_23_7_1_c2d1b3a6a5.png" alt="technical analysis of bitcoin on a daily chart">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Bitcoin on a daily chart</span>
<h2>4H chart</h2>
<p>For a while, the situation on a 4H chart was suggesting that we were going to hit a new low. At one point, we were really close to it thanks to the rising intensity and high volumes being manifested in the decline. But then, the mentioned webinar took place and the price went up immediately. The price of altcoins also rose sharply. As you can see from my chart, nothing is certain in the short term and we can still go for the new LOW. Bitcoin has not yet been able to overcome the trend. However, its rebound from the support was very promising. Amidst all this, JP Morgan announced that they will be the first bank in the United States to offer cryptocurrencies to wealthy clients.</p>
<p>Strong support backed by mentioned positive news pushed the price of Bitcoin up and at least for some time averted the threat of fall below $ 30,000.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Bitcoin on a 4H chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Be that as it may, nothing is still certain and until the trend line is definitively broken, Bitcoin can still go for the new low. But one thing is certain, this week was a turning point in terms of fundamental news as all of them were positive and impactful.</p>

<Title>XAG/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.30%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.37%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.67%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.62%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>-1.16%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently slightly positive (<strong>1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>1</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. Indexing is currently on its way north. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210724_cycles_987b548ab5.jpg" alt="XAG/USD daily price indexation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. <strong>XAG/USD</strong>
 fell below short-term and long-term MAs last week. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, all MAs support bearish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210724_Mo_M_db138e3b87.jpg" alt="XAG/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, there have been more declining trends, with a maximum of <strong>5</strong>
 consecutive days. The total maximum for the downtrend for the last <strong>3</strong>
 years is <strong>8</strong>
 days. Upward trends have not exceeded more than <strong>3</strong>
 consecutive days in recent months. The total maximum for the last <strong>3</strong>
 years is <strong>6</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.30%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>1.94%</strong>
, which is below the average value. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.0%</strong>
 and <strong>3.0%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>4.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to neutral sentiment in recent months. <strong>XAG/USD</strong>
 is currently very close to the psychological level of <strong>25.00</strong>
. In addition, it is in the demand zone (green rectangle), where are also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 and the long-term moving average. The divergence between price development and the RSI could also motive short-term bulls. In the event of a further decline below the demand zone, bears could push the price to <strong>22.00</strong>
 or even close to the psychological level of <strong>20.00</strong>
.</p>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: Have Uniswap just made a mistake?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Delisting of stock tokens</h2>
<p>Only few days ago, Uniswap Labs tweeted that it has restricted an access to a number of tokens through app.uniswap.org. The official statement, which you can <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/token-access-app/">read here</a>
 specifies that this was done due to the evolving regulatory landscape. Uniswap Labs have reassured that the Uniswap is still permissionless, immutable and autonomous.</p>
<p>List of all the affected tokens can be <a href="https://github.com/Uniswap/uniswap-interface/blob/main/src/constants/tokenLists/unsupported.tokenlist.json">found here</a>
. These are mostly synthetic tokens or stocks that were only a small portion of volume of Uniswap Protocol. Gold Tether, Grump Cat or mirrored Amazon and mirrored Tesla were amongst the delisted tokens. Uniswap Labs perceives this step as a necessary step in the right direction of evolution of regulations connected to DeFi interfaces. The statement reiterated that users of Uniswap Protocol do not have to worry about safety or decentralized nature of the protocol.</p>
<span class="quote-author"> “Importantly, the Uniswap Protocol – unlike the interface – is set of autonomous, decentralized and immutable smart contracts. It provides unrestricted access to anyone with an Internet connection. Similarly, this action has no impact on the Uniswap Interface code, which remains open source, or the many other portals or locally run instances used to access the Uniswap Protocol.” 
</span>
<span class="post-quote">Uniswap Labs</span>
<p>Yet, concerns might arise as to how far Uniswap Labs might go in the future to support the rising restrictions. Gary Gensler, Chairman of the SEC, has only recently stated that all platforms are implicated by the securities laws and must work within securities regime that the SEC states.</p>
<span class="quote-author">“Make no mistake: It does not matter whether it is a stock token, a stable value token backed by securities or any other virtual product that provides synthetic exposure to underlying securities.” 
</span>
<span class="post-quote">Gary Gensler, Chairman of SEC</span>
<p>The pressure from the side of regulators will therefore continue and only then can the cryptocurrency world see, which platforms or solutions are truly decentralized and will remain unaffected by it, and which will abide to the new rules.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Uniswap is a leading decentralized finance exchange (DEX) that is being used more than vast majority of centralized exchanges. The latest step from the Uniswap Labs, a software development studio of Uniswap which has some decision-making power over interfaces like app.uniswap.org shows, that this DEX might not be as decentralized as first thought.</Excerpt>

<Title>Exchanges are gradually reducing popular leverage trading</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What is leverage trading?</h2>
<p>Leveraged trading is <strong>borrowing of funds</strong>
 so that you can take a larger position than you could with your own funds. This type of trading was created to <strong>increase potential profit.</strong>
 For example, with a leverage of 100x and an investment of $ 1,000, you are actually trading with $ 100,000 and your potential profit can be much higher. Some exchanges even offer leverage up to 125x.</p>
<p>On the other hand, such trading also <strong>carries significant risks.</strong>
 All you need is a slight market fluctuation and you can lose everything in a minute. In our example, with leverage 100x, it is enough for the price of a given asset to fall by 1% and the trader loses his entire deposit through so-called liquidation. Experienced traders therefore advise newcomers to avoid leverage completely.</p>
<h2>The leverage is reduced by the Binance exchange as well as the FTX</h2>
<p>Both well-known crypto exchanges announced in a relatively short period of time that they will continue to provide this type of trading to their users, but the maximum leverage will be significantly lower. Binance co-founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao said in a tweet on Sunday that they had begun limiting new users to a <strong>maximum leverage of 20x</strong>
 as of July 19. This change will gradually be reflected in existing user accounts as well.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Cryptocurrency coin and financial chart, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>The move came just 2 months after the announcement of support for BTC / USDT contracts with up to 125x leverage. Over the past two months, Binance has faced <strong>regulatory pressure in several jurisdictions,</strong>
 including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Cayman Islands, Italy, Poland, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand and Singapore.</p>
<span class="quote-author">"In the interest of Consumer Protection, we will apply this to existing users progressively over the next few weeks."</span>
<span class="post-quote">Changpeng Zhao, Binance Co-Founder and CEO</span>
<p>A similar policy was applied by the Hong Kong cryptocurrency <strong>exchange FTX,</strong>
 which reduced the maximum <strong>leverage from the previous 101x to 20x.</strong>
 Sam Bankman-Fried, founder and CEO of FTX, stated that high leverage trading accounted for only a small amount of the exchange's trading volumes. He also said that this was the direction that the whole industry has been heading for a long time. In his view, margin systems must be liquidated as a backup, but to do so infrequently. <strong>The average leverage used on the FTX is only 2x.</strong>
</p>
<h2>Steps of these big exchanges are probably not just preventive</h2>
<p>Some experts argue that in some cases the leverage is not a healthy part of the crypto industry. These risky trades are considered to be one of the drivers of the May market downturn. In addition, the timing of the changes on FTX and Binance suggests that they did not occur by chance and are likely to be <strong>part of ongoing regulatory battle.</strong>
 The theory is also supported by the recent change on the decentralized exchange <strong>Uniswap, which has delisted several stock tokens on its platform.</strong>
 The Binance Exchange also announced that stock tokens will no longer be part of their offer. Thus, individual companies seem to be preparing in advance for the arrival of tougher regulatory rules.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken and Gemini have chosen a different strategy and <strong>avoid any conflict with regulators</strong>
 around the world. According to their leaders, this is a much better practice in the long run, which will also give them a <strong>significant competitive advantage in the future.</strong>
 That is why Coinbase is listed on the well-known stock exchange Nasdaq, and Kraken exchange, which has obtained a regulated bank charter in Wyoming, is also preparing for this step.</p>

<Title>NZD/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.58%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.60%,</strong>
 respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.30%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.29%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was <strong>0.37%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>1</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in a slightly positive phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to all MAs, <strong>NZD/USD</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment because it is below them. In the case of growth, monthly and annual MAs, which are very close to each other, could be the first important resistance for the exchange rate</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210727_Mo_M_e8ab9b9cc9.jpg" alt="NZD/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>There have been longer upward trends since our last analysis, with a maximum of <strong>4</strong>
 consecutive days. The maximum in the measured period is <strong>6</strong>
 days. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. The maximum in the measured period is <strong>8</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.97%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.90%</strong>
, which is very close to the average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.2%</strong>
 and <strong>1.2%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>2.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to bearish sentiment since the beginning of this year. This pair has been declining dynamically since our last analysis. However, it has been in the stabilization phase for the last few weeks. We can also clearly see the bullish divergence between the market price and the RSI, which moved the pair back to the demand zone (green rectangle), where are also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 and the important psychological level of <strong>0.7000</strong>
. Therefore, a possible bear trap was created. In the case of growth, the long-term moving average, together with short-term MA could be strong resistance to bulls.</p>

<Excerpt>The current price of the NZD/USD exchange rate is 0.6970 (July 27, 2021). This pair is currently trading at an important level. The New Zealand dollar is highly correlated with commodities and the strengthening of the USD is usually much higher if commodity prices fall. Let’s look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>Investro Tea: Week #30</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>US crisis</h2>
<p>US President Joe Biden continues his efforts to protect the economy from the crisis. Biden seeks to reduce monthly mortgage payments by up to 25% for those who have mortgages covered by federal funds and whose grace period expires.</p>
<p>The aim of this state program is to prevent a sharp increase in the number of confiscated properties in the coming months. In total, up to 1.6 million homeowners are in serious arrears, which means they have not been paying for at least 90 days. The nationwide ban on foreclosure will expire on July 31.</p>
<p>You can read more about this program <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-aid-planned-for-mortgage-borrowers-at-risk-of-foreclosure-11627032601">here</a>

<span class="img-caption">Joe Biden, the president of USA Source: https://www.whitehouse.gov/</span>
<p>The pandemic crisis is not only reflected in the economy but also in demography. The United States has seen the smallest population growth in history. As many as half of its states have recorded a decline in population. The total growth of the population was only 0.35% and the consequences will of course not be apparent immediately, but rather in the generations to come once the current productive part of the population will retire. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-population-growth-slows-birth-rate-decline-economic-risk-11627231536">More on the Wall Street Journal</a>
.</p>
<p>The crisis is affecting also the supply chains. With goods such as wood, steel, and computer chips being highly scarce. TSMC's CEO said the company was in the early stages of considering building a chip plant in Germany to help address the global chip shortage, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/tsmc-mulls-german-japan-plants-to-diversify-supply-chain">more in Bloomberg magazine</a>
.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency window</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrencies grew aggressively over the weekend. Bitcoin managed to get + 12% and peaked at around $ 38,250 and Ether grew by + 9% to $ 2,300. The price of Bitcoin probably rose based on the information that Amazon will start accepting BTC as currency. However, Amazon immediately denied this information.</p>
<p>This week, we recommend you to read our article on Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence. <a href="https://investro.com/crypto/blockchain-and-ai-as-technologies-of-the-future">You can read it here</a>

<Title>Technical Analysis of Gold and Silver</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Gold</h2>
<p>The gold was moving in a correction in the past 2 weeks, albeit not a too serious one with very strong support at the level of $ 1783 - 1792. In addition, the movement in the correction began to form under the trend line, so it was only a matter of time before gold would have enough strength to overcome it. That has finally happened this week. As the nearest swing target, I see the level of $ 1867 - 1876. The trend line from the daily chart also intervenes here. As this is a swing trade, this trade can last for several weeks. However, everything is set so that the gold should test the above-mentioned level.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/technika_gold_a6afabc1fd.png" alt="technical analysis of gold">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Technical analysis of gold</span>
<h2>Silver</h2>
<p>Silver does not look that promising yet. In addition, it has been under a long-term trend since June 11, 2021. So the price has been in a correction for over a month and the trend line has not yet been surpassed. I see strong support at $ 23.77 - 24.37. The question is whether silver will come to this support before the break of the trend or not. In any case, going long will pay off only in case the price will break through the trend.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Commodities have finally rebounded from their structures. While in gold we overcame the local trend and we can start going upwards, on silver we will have to wait. In any case, both charts are bullish for the coming weeks, and any decline should only be a correction for the trend.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Today I would like to briefly describe the current situation on gold and silver. Gold has already surpassed the local trend while silver is preparing for it. But what does this tell us in the longer term? Let’s cover it in today’s technical analysis.</Excerpt>

<Title>Fundament of the week - Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What is DAO and how does it work?</h2>
<p>DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Simply put, DAO is an organization that follows computer code and programs. As such, it has the ability to function autonomously without the need for a central authority.</p>
<p>Using smart contracts, DAO can work with and execute commands based on external information. All without human intervention. The DAO is commonly run by a community of stakeholders, motivated through some particular token mechanism.</p>
<p>DAO transaction rules and records are transparently stored in a blockchain. The rules are usually decided by a vote of the parties involved. Typically, decisions within the DAO are made through proposals. As soon as a majority of stakeholders vote on the proposal (or as soon as they comply with some other rules set out in the network consensus rules), the decision will be implemented.</p>
<p>In some respects, the DAO functions similarly to a society or a nation-state, but in a bit more decentralized way. While traditional organizations work with a hierarchical structure and many layers of bureaucracy, DAOs have no hierarchy. Instead, DAOs use economic mechanisms to reconcile the interests of an organization with the interests of its members, usually through game theory.</p>
<p>DAO members are not bound by any formal agreement. Rather, they are united by a common goal and network incentives associated with consensus rules. These rules are completely transparent and are written in open-source software that governs the organization. Because DAOs operate despite the state borders, they may be subject to different legal jurisdictions.</p>
<p>As the name implies, DAO is decentralized and autonomous. Decentralized because no entity has the authority to take and enforce decisions. And autonomous because it can work on its own.</p>
<p>Once a DAO is deployed, it cannot be controlled by one party, but rather is managed by a community of participants. If the management rules defined in the protocol are designed correctly, it should lead the actors to the most favorable result for the network.</p>
<p>Simply put, DAOs provide an operating system for open collaboration. This operating system allows individuals and institutions to collaborate without having to get to know each other or trust each other.</p>
<h2>DAO and the principal-agent problem</h2>
<p>DAO solves a problem that is called the principal-agent dilemma in economics.  It happens when a person or agent has the ability to make decisions and act on behalf of another person or entity. If the agent is motivated to act in his own interest, he does not have to take into account the interests of the represented party.</p>
<p>This situation allows the agent to take the risk on behalf of the entity. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that there may be information asymmetries between the subject and the agent. The entity may never know that something like this is happening and has no way of making sure that the agent is acting in his best interests.</p>
<p>Common examples of this problem occur in elected representatives representing citizens, intermediaries representing investors or managers representing shareholders.</p>
<p>By allowing a higher degree of transparency enabled by blockchains, well-designed stimulus models behind DAO can eliminate parts of this problem. The stimuli in the organization are consistent and there is very little (or no) information asymmetry. Because all transactions are recorded on a blockchain, DAO operation is completely transparent and theoretically makes them inviolable.
Examples of DAO
The Bitcoin network, although being quite primitive, can be considered the first example of DAO. It operates in a decentralized manner and is coordinated by a consensus protocol without a hierarchy between the participants.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin protocol defines the rules of the organization, while Bitcoin as a currency provides users with an incentive to secure networks. This ensures that different participants can work together to keep Bitcoin running, as a decentralized autonomous organization.</p>
<p>The common goal in the case of Bitcoin is to store and transfer value without the central entity coordinating the system. But what else could DAO be used for?</p>
<p>More complex DAOs can be deployed for a variety of applications. For example, for token management, decentralized hedge funds or social media platforms. DAOs could also coordinate the operation of devices connected to the Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
<p>In addition, these innovations introduced a subset of DAOs called Decentralized Autonomous Corporations (DACs). The DAC can provide similar services as for example a traditional carpooling company. The difference is that it works without a corporate governance structure, as is the case with traditional companies.</p>
<p>If we stick to this example we can imagine a car that owns itself and provides a ride as part of a DAC. This means that it could operate autonomously and carry out transactions with people and other devices. Thanks to the use of blockchain oracles, it could even trigger intelligent contracts and perform certain tasks by itself. For example, drive itself to a mechanic.</p>
<h2>What problem do DAOs face?</h2>
<p><strong>Legality</strong>

The regulatory environment around DAO is completely uncertain. How different jurisdictions will create a regulatory framework for these new types of organizations remains to be seen. However, a persistently uncertain regulatory environment could be a significant barrier to DAO adoption.</p>
<p><strong>Coordinated attacks</strong>

The desirable characteristics of DAO (decentralization, consistency, distrust) have, in essence, significant disadvantages in terms of performance and security. Some of the potential organizations, that may emerge as DAOs, pose a major risk that does not exist in traditional organizations.</p>
<p><strong>Centralization points</strong>

It has been proven that decentralization is not a state, but rather the extent to which each level is suitable for a different type of use. In some cases, full autonomy or decentralization may not be possible or will not make sense.</p>
<p>DAOs can enable cooperation to a wider range of actors than ever before, but the management rules set out in the protocol will always be a place of centralization. It can be argued that centralized organizations can operate with much greater efficiency, all this at the expense of the elimination of open participation benefits.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>DAOs allow organizations to break out of trust that is often put in traditional institutions. Instead of the central body coordinating the participants, the management rules are automated and guide the actors towards the most favorable outcome for the network.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin network can be considered a simplified DAO and so far there are few other implementations. The key to designing good DAOs is to establish an effective set of consensus rules that address the complex issues of participant coordination. The real challenge facing the implementation of DAO may not be purely technological, but rather social.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Blockchains are already radically transforming our financial system.  Among other things, this technology could also pave a way for entirely new types of organizations. The ones that could operate autonomously without the need for coordination by a central body.  This article ponders the extent to which these organizations might go.</Excerpt>

<Title>XCU/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.25%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.20%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.63%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.58%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>-0.88%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently negative (<strong>-1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-3</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the very first negative phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. <strong>XCU/USD</strong>
 has risen above short-term and medium-term MAs in recent weeks. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, all MAs support bullish sentiment.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, we have witnessed more upward trends that did not exceed <strong>4</strong>
 consecutive days. The total maximum in the measured period (last 3 years) is <strong>11</strong>
 days. Downward trends in recent months have not exceeded more than <strong>3</strong>
 days. The total maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>12</strong>
 days. We could use the average annual ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.77%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>1.34%</strong>
, which is below average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-2.5%</strong>
 and <strong>2.5%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>3.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<p>The basic technical analysis currently supports short-term bullish sentiment, as the commodity price has been rising dynamically since mid-July. However, volumes increased only slightly. The <strong>XCU/USD</strong>
 is currently approaching the important psychological level of <strong>4.6500</strong>
, which could be resistance to the price. The divergence between price development and the RSI could also motive short-term bears. However, the price could be supported by a short-term moving average. In the event of a further decline, the demand zone (green rectangle) could be important for bulls.</p>

<Title>When will countries stop perceiving cryptocurrencies negatively?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>It is time for governments to stop demonizing cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>El-Erian, who advises Allianz and Gramercy fund management companies, has recently commented on the subject. He <strong>calls national governments to stop the senseless rejection of digital currencies</strong>
 and to label them as illegal payment schemes and reckless financial speculation. It is a fact that cryptocurrencies have undergone considerable and difficult development, and El-Erian thinks that <strong>the only reason for this approach by governments is, in fact, their fear</strong>
 of losing control of the financial system.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/bitcoin_trapped_with_chains_1d889d7dad.jpg" alt="Bitcoin trapped with chains">
<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin trapped with chains, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>The cryptocurrency market can certainly (especially compared to others) be considered young, but it already offers quality and secure solutions to the problems of traditional finances. If we use these opportunities properly, it could <strong>lead to a significant recovery of the global economy.</strong>
 It would certainly help cryptocurrencies and various companies operating in this sector if governments were more open to the new financial world. Currently, the situation seems to be that they are trying to slow down cryptocurrencies and create various barriers for all participants in this market.</p>
<p>Of course, <strong>the sceptical view of the crypto market did not arise suddenly,</strong>
 and in the past, the cryptocurrency industry could have been considered the "Wild West" with a number of different scams. <strong>However, the situation has changed significantly over time</strong>
 and government support would certainly help the whole sector. For crypto companies, in particular, good regulatory frameworks are key, which will protect people but will not unnecessarily create various barriers. In addition, governments that understand the importance of cryptocurrencies first, can gain a significant competitive advantage in this regard from the perspective of the global economy and attract a lot of investment into their jurisdiction.</p>
<h2>Germany is taking an important step in the right direction</h2>
<p>It is good news that <strong>some governments are gradually beginning to see the importance of cryptocurrencies</strong>
 and are supporting their development and adoption in their country. Important step was taken by Germany, which has currently <strong>legalized the possession of cryptocurrencies by German institutions</strong>
 through a new law. This could bring a large amount of new investment to the cryptocurrency market and is estimated to be as high as $ 415 million. The German government has also set a limit so that companies can hold a maximum of 20% of their assets in cryptocurrencies, which is to ensure that companies do not disappear as a result of a possible market collapse.</p>
<p>The new laws will make it easier for large companies to invest in cryptocurrencies, and this is, therefore, a very fundamental innovation. In addition, being one of the world's largest and most powerful economies may <strong>put pressure on other states to adopt similar rules.</strong>
 At the same time, Germany has one of the largest ETF markets in the crypto sector, which is certainly important, as many people will also be interested in indirect investments in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>We see pressure for wider acceptance of cryptocurrencies worldwide</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, <strong>Zeno Staub,</strong>
 CEO of the Swiss group of private banking and investment management Vontobel Holding AG, <strong>spoke about the interest of their clients in cryptocurrencies.</strong>
 In their company, they believe in blockchain technology, which creates absolute trust without the presence of a centralized unit. They already offer their clients the opportunity to purchase cryptocurrencies in a convenient, safe and easy-to-use way. They see in the results that if clients do not have to worry about the general terms of purchase and management of these assets, they are inclined to invest part of their resources in cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>A similar view was expressed in an interview with <strong>Alli McCartney,</strong>
 who is a private consultant at UBS and also stated that she <strong>sees interest in Bitcoin, especially among wealthy investors.</strong>
 These are clients who have earned their money in traditional financial markets, but understand the concept of risk-taking.</p>
<span class="quote-author">“The story of the first couple of years was that here was a store of value that was apolitical and could be a diversifier. And then you fast-forward and, to my colleague’s point, you see the numbers going up, which always gets people interested. You see the adoption in the form of Bloomberg Galaxy Index. Then you go to Fidelity being a custodian and now you are at PayPal letting you buy and sell with it.”</span>
<span class="post-quote">Alli McCartney, Private Wealth Advisor at UBS</span>
<p>The global adoption of cryptocurrencies is thus well underway and it can be assumed that <strong>pressure from investors will force governments to think differently about digital assets.</strong>
 In addition, by creating clear regulations whose sole interest will be investor protection, they could speed up the adoption of cryptocurrencies and allow the influx of large amounts of new institutional capital.</p>

<Excerpt>It is almost unbelievable that, despite the millions of users and the amount of effort of various companies, cryptocurrencies are still described by governments and their representatives as scams or speculation. What is the reason?</Excerpt>

 for price indexation. This means that we are still in the positive phase of the cycle. However, we could be close to the peak of this short-term cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>

<p>Basic technical analysis supports short-term bearish sentiment after the June’s dynamic decline. However, this pair has recently rebounded from an important demand zone (green rectangle), where there is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 at the bottom. We can see the bullish divergence between the market price and the RSI, which was created last month. <strong>EUR/USD</strong>
 is currently trading sideways as there has been a longer-term bearish divergence. In the event of a further growth, the psychological level of <strong>1.2000</strong>
 and long-term MA could represent an important resistance to the exchange rate.</p>

<Title>Investro Tea: Week #31</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>While pandemic is weakening in Western countries, other parts of the world are not as able to fight Covid-19, mainly because of the spread of the Delta variant. The currently weakest link in an otherwise strong global economic recovery is Asia which still suffers not only from the delta variant of Covid-19 but also production and export restrictions.</p>
<p>Due to the slower vaccination progress that is lagging behind the West, Asia is reaching a new pandemic peak and the Delta variant is also to blame. While 40% of the population in advanced economies has already been fully vaccinated, in emerging economies is less than 20%. Countries that are hit the hardest belong to Southeast Asia resulting in new social restrictions. You can read more about the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Asian economy in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/delta-variant-stalls-asias-economic-recovery-after-early-rebound-11627922736">Wall Street Journal</a>

<h2>Let’s stay in Asia for a while</h2>
<p>Shares of Tencent and its competitors fell sharply after Chinese state newspapers criticized online gambling, raising fears that the companies' games might be included in greater state intervention and censorship. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-plummets-as-china-takes-aim-at-online-videogames-11627962018">More info here</a>

<p>It is important to mention that Tencent owns 48% of the American company Epic Games, which is not only responsible for the world-renowned Unreal Engine, the Epic Games Store launcher, which is almost the only competitor of Valve and their Steam store but it is also behind the extremely successful Fortnite brand.</p>

<Title>Technical Analysis of Tesla, Apple, and Facebook shares</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Tesla</h2>
<p>Tesla was keeping it quiet for a few weeks now. That is maybe the reason why the chart went sideways as growth is usually connected with hyped news or overall humbug. Despite the fact that, in my opinion, Tesla’s stocks are still very significantly overpriced, it looks like they will probably reach a new maximum. After a long time, the price has overcome the triangle pattern, and currently, it is starting to grow below the trend line.
Now Tesla would need to beat the previous HIGH at $ 769. However, as long as we keep the dashed trend, we might get to the new high soon.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/Stocks_1_280cfe435a.png" alt="Technical analysis of Tesla's stocks">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Tesla shares on 1D time frame</span>
<h2>Facebook</h2>
<p>With Facebook, it is a different story. Its shares have been growing smoothly for several weeks and gave us a new maximum recently. In terms of technical analysis, the price has reached a conservative target of $ 365, in my opinion. However, Facebook stocks price is still following the trend line and overall it is still following the rising trend, so there is currently no reason for it to change. However, if change were to come, it would have happened only in case that Facebook fell through the trend and created a lower low. Until then, the price will continue to adhere to the new ATH.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/Stocks_2_b14949dca6.png" alt="Technical analysis of Facebook stocks">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Facebook shares on 1D time frame</span>
<h2>Apple</h2>
<p>The most valuable company in the world is also at its maximum and according to the chart, it looks like a new maximum will soon follow. If we take a closer look at the chart, we can see that Apple is currently in the triangle on the 4H chart. Therefore, I would expect a final break of $ 155 per share.</p>
<p>The price of Apple stocks went sideways as well, but then it created a channel that was subsequently broken without any difficulties. A mentioned breakthrough was absolutely crucial because if the price had not broken through, we would still be talking about a corrective structure. However, it was this breakthrough that caused the growth to continue, so it is very likely that if the price of Apple stocks breaks the triangle to 4H, it will go up again.</p>

<Title>Fundament of the week: Transaction fees on the blockchain</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Why do we need transaction fees?</h2>
<p>Transaction fees do exist also in the realm of defi more specifically in blockchain transactions and have been an essential part of most blockchain systems since their inception. You have most likely stumbled upon them while you were sending, depositing, or withdrawing cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Most cryptocurrencies use transaction fees for two main reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, charges reduce the amount of spam on the network. That is because implementing large-scale spam attacks is costly which is something “spammers” will think twice about.</p>
<p>Second, transaction fees act as an incentive for users to help verify transactions. You can perceive it as a reward for helping the network.</p>
<p>With most blockchains, transaction fees are reasonably cheap but depending on network traffic, they can be quite expensive. As a user, the amount you choose to pay in fees determines the priority of your transaction when you add it to the next block. The higher the fee paid, the faster the confirmation process.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin transaction fees</h2>
<p>As the world's first blockchain network, Bitcoin has set the standard for transaction fees used by many cryptocurrencies today. Satoshi Nakamoto realized that transaction fee can protect the network from large-scale spam attacks and stimulate good behavior.</p>
<p>Bitcoin miners receive transaction fees as part of the process of committing transactions to a new block. A group of unconfirmed transactions is called a <strong>mempool</strong>
. Miners will naturally prefer transactions with higher fees that users have agreed to pay when sending their BTCs to another bitcoin wallet.</p>
<p>Criminal entities wishing to slow down the network must therefore pay a fee associated with each transaction. If they set the fee too low, miners are likely to ignore their transactions. If they put them on the right level, they will incur high economic costs. Transaction fees therefore also function as a simple but effective spam filter.</p>
<h2>How are BTC transaction fees calculated?</h2>
<p>In a bitcoin network, certain crypto wallets allow users to manually set transaction fees. It is also possible to send BTCs with zero fees, but miners are most likely to ignore such transactions, which means these transactions will not be verified.</p>
<p>BTC transaction fees do not depend on the amount sent, but on the size of the transaction (in bytes).</p>
<p>For example, imagine that the size of your transaction is <strong>400</strong>
 bytes and the average transaction fee is now <strong>80</strong>
 satoshi per byte. In that case, you would have to pay around <strong>32,000</strong>
 satoshis (or <strong>0.00032 BTC</strong>
) to have a good chance of adding your transaction to the next block.</p>
<p>When network traffic is high and there is a high demand for sending BTCs, the transaction fee required for fast transaction confirmation increases when other Bitcoin users try to have it confirmed too. This can happen during periods of high market volatility.</p>
<p>High fees as such can therefore make it difficult to use BTC in everyday situations. Buying a cup of coffee for $ 3 may not be practical if the fees are even higher.</p>
<p>Only a certain number of transactions can be included in a block with a limit of 1 MB (i.e. block size). Miners add these blocks to the blockchain as quickly as possible, but there is still a limit to how fast they can go.</p>
<p>The scalability of cryptocurrency networks is a crucial issue when setting the network fees. Blockchain developers are constantly working to resolve this issue. Previous network updates have helped to improve scalability. These were updates such as the implementation of <strong>SegWit</strong>
 and <strong>Lightning Network</strong>
.</p>
<h2>ETH transaction fees</h2>
<p>Transaction fees on Ethereum work differently from those of BTC. The fee takes into account the amount of computing power required to process a transaction referred to as gas. Gas also has a variable price measured in ETH, the network's native token.</p>
<p>While the gas needed for a particular transaction may remain the same, its price may differ. That is because this price is directly related to network traffic. If you pay a higher gas price, the miners are likely to prefer your transaction.</p>
<h2>How are Ethereum transaction fees calculated?</h2>
<p>The total gas fee is simply the price that covers the costs, plus the incentive to process your transaction. However, you should also consider the gas limit, which defines the maximum price paid for a given transaction or task.</p>
<p>In other words, the gas price represents the amount of work required and the price for "every hour" of work. The relationship between these two prices and the gas limit defines the total fee for an Ethereum transaction or for a smart contract operation.</p>
<p>As an example, let's choose a random transaction on the Etherscan.io website. The transaction cost <strong>21,000</strong>
 gas and its price was <strong>71</strong>
 Gwei. Thus, the total transaction fee was <strong>1,491,000</strong>
 Gwei or <strong>0.001491</strong>
 ETH.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/gas_1_0317980f3c.png" alt="Etherscan.io transaction">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Transaction fee demonstration from Etherscan.io</span>
<p>When Ethereum gets to the Proof of Stake model, gas charges can be expected to fall. The amount of gas needed to confirm the transaction will be lower, as the network will only need a fraction of the computing power to verify the transactions. However, network transmission can still affect transaction fees, as validators prefer higher-paying transactions.</p>
<h2>Binance Chain transaction fees</h2>
<p>Binance Chain is a blockchain network that allows users to trade BNBs and other BEP-2 tokens. Apart from that, users can also create and distribute their own tokens. Binance Chain adopts a consensus mechanism called Delegated Proof of Stake. So instead of miners, we have validators.</p>
<p>Binance Chain also powers Binance DEX (decentralized exchange), where users can trade crypto assets directly from their wallets. Transaction fees for Binance Chain and DEX are paid in the BNB. Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain are two different blockchains.</p>
<h2>How are Binance Chain transaction fees calculated?</h2>
<p>Depending on the action you intend to make, the fee structure in the BNB applies. Binance DEX distinguishes between transaction fees, such as BNB sending, and fees for trading. The total transaction price may also fluctuate depending on the market price of the BNB.</p>
<p>For non-trade-related transactions, such as the withdrawal or deposit of a BNB in a wallet, the fees are paid in BNB only. Fees for trading on Binance DEX are payable in the traded token. However, there is a discount for payment in BNB. This scheme helps to stimulate the adoption of the BNB token and build its user base.</p>
<h2>Transaction fees in Binance Smart Chain</h2>
<p>Binance Smart Chain (BSC) is another blockchain built by Binance that runs in parallel with Binance Chain (i.e. two separate networks). While the BNB running on the Binance Chain is a BEP-2 token, the BNB on the BSC is a BEP-20 token.</p>
<p>The Binance smart chain allows you to create smart contracts, making it more customizable. The fee structure on the BSC is not as rigid as on the Binance Chain. Instead, a gas system (similar to the Ethereum system) is used, which reflects the computing power required to perform transactions and operate with smart contracts.</p>
<p>The BSC uses the Proof of Authority consensus mechanism. Network users must use the BNB to become a validator and will receive transaction fees after successful block validation has been completed.</p>
<h2>How are transaction fees calculated in Binance Smart Chain?</h2>
<p>As already mentioned, the structure of the BSC fees is very similar to the structure found on Ethereum. Transaction fees are calculated in Gwei, which is a small nominal value of BNB equal to <strong>0.000000001</strong>
. Users can set their gas prices to prioritize their transactions added to the block.</p>
<p>To find out the current and historical average gas price, BscScan provides the daily average along with the lowest and highest price paid. Since March 2021, the average BSC fee has been around 13 Gwei.</p>
<p>In the example below (taken from Bscscan.com), the price of gas was <strong>10</strong>
 Gwei. The gas limit was set at <strong>622,732</strong>
 Gwei, but only <strong>352,755 (52.31%)</strong>
 Gwei was used in this transaction, resulting in a transaction fee of BNB <strong>0.00325755</strong>
.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/gas_2_9d7554e28e.png" alt="Transaction demonstration from Etherscan.io">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Binance smart chain transaction</span>
<p>BSC fees are usually very low, but if you try to send tokens without having a BNB on your account, the network will alert you that you do not have enough funds. That is why you should not forget to leave some other BNBs in your wallet so that you can pay for the transaction fees.</p>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>Transaction fees are an integral part of the crypto-economics of blockchain networks. They are part of the incentives provided to users who keep the network up and running. Fees also provide a certain layer of protection against malicious behavior and spam.</p>
<p>However, the volume of traffic received by some networks has led to significantly higher fees being charged. The decentralized nature of most blockchains makes it difficult for them to scale. It is true that some networks provide high scalability and throughput of transactions, but this often comes with a certain trade-off in terms of security or decentralization.</p>
<p>There are still several researchers and developers working on improvements that will hopefully bring more inclusion when it comes to the use of cryptocurrencies in the developing world.</p>

<Excerpt>Transaction fees on blockchain networks serve two basic purposes. They reward miners or validators who help confirm transactions and they also protect the network from spam attacks. While high fees may hinder the wider acceptance of a blockchain, very low fees can potentially cause security concerns. Let's look at them closer.</Excerpt>

<Title>Technical Analysis of Bitcoin</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>The situation on the 1M chart</h2>
<p>After 3 months, we finally closed the positive candle which is the first impulse for the price to go up. As I have said many times, the growth we saw in winter and spring was really unconventional, because we have been growing for half a year. From this point of view, it only made sense that “punishment” has to come. At this point, we can see 3 classic market cycles. Growth, decline, and all we lack now is a consolidation in which we might be right now.</p>
<p>That is the reason why I would wait with any great expectations regarding the BTC price during August or even during September. Even if BTC would have closed in red this month, it would not mean anything. The only thing that might be considered as a problem would be closing the body of the candle below $ 34,800 or creating a new LOW.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Technical analysis of BTC on 1M chart</span>
<h2>The weekly chart might be the right place to look</h2>
<p>The monthly chart did not tell us that much. However, it told us that the bulls have finally shown strength and will not let go of the $ 30,000 threshold easily. So let's find the answer on the weekly chart.</p>
<p><strong>Last week was very important for Bitcoin in several respects. On the weekly candle, we have:</strong>
</p>
<li>Closed above EMA21 and EMA34</li>
<li>Created a new peak with the wick</li>
<li>Created a new peak with the body of the candle</li>
<p>The ideal situation would be if the body of the candle closed above the level of 41,252 USD, which did not happen. Despite the fact that the chart is now, of course, more bullish, we are still in the range between 28,584 - 41,282 USD. It is still true that if we definitely exceed the upper range limit, then the bull market will continue. The same goes for the lower limit and the bear market. However, as I said about the monthly chart, I would expect a bigger fight, at this point. I think we will be in this rank for some time before we finally break the upper limit.</p>
<p>However, the bear market is definitely not over yet as it is still a valid scenario. If we dropped to somewhere around $ 30,000 again at this stage, it would be very bad. Now it is best to stay at least at $ 35,000. The longer the price stays at the upper range limit, the higher the chance of it breaking through and going up.</p>

<Excerpt>Today, we will try to look at Bitcoin from a broader perspective. Since many traders might have already forgotten the bear market which was still relevant a week ago, let’s answer a question at hand - is the threat of the bear market definitely over?</Excerpt>

<Title>XAU/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.76%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.77%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.40%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.36%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>-2.29%</strong>
, which is above the second standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-1</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
, which means that we estimate the negative phase of the cycle. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. <strong>XAU/USD</strong>
 fell below the medium-term MA again yesterday. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, all MAs currently support bearish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210806_Mo_M_bc96cc1b56.jpg" alt="XAU/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, we have witnessed more upward trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>5</strong>
 consecutive days. However, the maximum increase was <strong>8</strong>
 days in the measured period. The downward trend in recent weeks have not exceeded more than <strong>2</strong>
 days. The maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>6</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.44%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>1.78%</strong>
, which is slightly above its long-term average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.6%</strong>
 and <strong>1.6%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>2.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis supports short-term bearish sentiment after yesterday’s dynamic decline. <strong>XAU/USD</strong>
 is currently very close to the support level of <strong>1 760</strong>
, where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50.00%</strong>
. The price is also below short-term and long-term moving averages. If it continues to decline, the demand zone (green rectangle), where are also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>61.80%</strong>
 and the psychological level of <strong>1 700</strong>
, could also provide some support for the bulls.</p>

<Excerpt>The current price of XAU/USD - Gold Spot US Dollar is 1 763 (August 06, 2021). This commodity is currently being traded in an important area after a decline caused mainly by the strengthening of the US dollar. It may still play a major role for this commodity in the near future. Let’s now look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: The industry is experiencing an extreme boom</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>The second quarter was particularly strong for Ethereum DeFi protocols</h2>
<p>During the second quarter of this year, we witnessed the strongest period so far for this innovative industry. According to a new analytical report called ConsenSys Q2 2021 DeFi Report, the number of addresses on the Ethereum network increased by 10% from April to June. However, <strong>the number of addresses using decentralized finance protocols has grown much faster, an increase of up to 65%.</strong>
 Active DeFi addresses still represent less than 2% of all Ethereum addresses.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/defi_to_the_moon_concept_add0f1990e.jpg" alt="DeFi "To the Moon" concept">
<span class="img-caption">DeFi "To the Moon" concept, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>DeFi applications and protocols are available on several blockchains - such as Binance Smart Chain and Solana. However, the <strong>largest share of their use still belongs to the Ethereum network,</strong>
 where they originated. These are blockchain protocols that remove banks and other intermediaries from various financial transactions and services. For example, users can directly (without an intermediary) exchange cryptocurrencies or make money by borrowing them.</p>
<h2>In DeFi, the ever-increasing financial value is locked</h2>
<p>Decentralized finances are moving forward at tremendous speed. Users can now enjoy relatively easy access to information (education), very interesting returns and also proven practices. This has also led to a sharp increase in awareness of DeFi and the number of e-wallets that have interacted with the industry. These include trading on decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (such as Uniswap), crypto loans (Compound), or liquidity funds (KeeperDAO).</p>
<p>Altogether, nearly <strong>3 million Ethereum addresses interacted with similar DeFi services.</strong>
 It is estimated that there may have been many more. The growth of DeFi is also reflected in the use of stablecoins, which are an ideal solution for users in situations where they want to avoid market volatility and, at the same time, be ready to buy at any time, without the need to use FIAT currencies. According to DeFi Pulse, <strong>DeFi protocols have tied assets worth nearly $ 70 billion.</strong>
 These protocols also hold up to a quarter of all USDC stablecoins.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>The statistics that monitor the development of decentralized finance are clear. The DeFi industry is constantly growing and is probably still just warming up.</Excerpt>

<Title>Coinbase will bring purchases via Apple Pay</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>The integration of one of the most popular payment instruments is an important step</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced through its blog post that they will include Apple Pay among the payment options for the purchase of cryptocurrencies on their platform. In addition, the company has in the past avoided applications connected to the world of cryptocurrencies, so this is an interesting change in general sentiment. It is important to understand that the cryptocurrency market is still young, and <strong>any facilitation of entry can significantly accelerate adoption.</strong>
</p>

<span class="img-caption">Coinbase logo with Bitcoins, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>In addition, the novelty comes at a time when <strong>we are seeing a very positive sentiment in the market,</strong>
 and the prices of cryptocurrencies are rising again. Investors are literally flocking to the market after a long time, and the data clearly show that the pressure to buy is significantly stronger than the pressure to sell. Similarly, the positive news is coming from across the market, so many analysts predict that the current situation may persist for some time.</p>
<h2>Coinbase expands its current range of services</h2>
<p>Already in June, the company introduced the <strong>possibility of connecting their crypto payment card to Apple Pay and Google Pay services.</strong>
 This was a welcomed move as users can now take advantage of crypto payments worldwide. However, there was still no way to buy through Apple Pay, which is currently considered one of the most trusted digital wallets. Users will thus not have to go through unnecessarily lengthy processes to purchase cryptocurrencies. The feature is expected to launch in the fall, and this will <strong>bring the access to a simple purchase of cryptocurrencies to 150 million users</strong>
 in 40 countries.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Apple Pay logo on the screen, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>The new service is part of Coinbase's efforts to add newer and more secure purchase options. The system will work on any device with the iOS operating system with the option of Apple Pay, or in the Safari browser. In addition, the company <strong>offers instant withdrawals of up to $ 100,000 per transaction</strong>
 through a system called <strong>Real-Time Payments (RTP).</strong>
 The process is available on the platform 24/7 and should offer not only speed, but also lower fees.</p>
<h2>There are also other interesting news planned</h2>
<p>Coinbase also announced that <strong>they are working to add also Google Pay option.</strong>
 This feature should be added during the year. The key focus of the exchange thus remains the provision of the widest possible range of options for the purchase of cryptocurrencies. It already allows buying through Visa and Mastercard in more than 20 countries around the world and plans to expand the list of these countries in the future.</p>
<p>The Coinbase <strong>application for the calculation of tax liability in individual countries is very popular</strong>
 and is becoming important mainly due to the tightening of regulations against exchanges, but also against cryptocurrency users themselves. The exchange also decided to <strong>purchase Zabo, a cryptocurrency data aggregator</strong>
 that connects financial applications and platforms with crypto exchanges, wallets and protocols via an API. The platform also provides an API that connects to crypto accounts on exchanges and tracks asset balances along with transaction history.</p>

<Title>GBP/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.43%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.43%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.21%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.21%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was only <strong>-0.01%</strong>
, which is well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-2</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that the periodic change is in the neutral stage and the indexation is in the declining phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210811_Cycles_395697eed3.jpg" alt="GBP/USD daily indexation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to the annual MA, <strong>GBP/USD</strong>
 is still in bullish sentiment. The monthly MA is currently supporting exchange rate.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>There have been more downward trends since our last analysis, when a maximum of <strong>3</strong>
 consecutive days was reached. However, upward trends in the same period also did not exceed <strong>3</strong>
 days. The maximum in the measured period is <strong>8</strong>
 days in the downtrend and <strong>9</strong>
 days in the uptrend. To estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions, we could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.81%</strong>
). The current value is <strong>0.29%</strong>
, which is below average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.0%</strong>
 and <strong>1.0%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis supports short-term bullish sentiment, as the exchange rate rebounds again from an important support level at <strong>1.3800</strong>
. In addition, <strong>GBP/USD</strong>
 has also recently been close to the demand zone (green rectangle) with a strong bottom, where are the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 and the long-term moving average. However, the divergence between price development and the RSI currently motivates short-term bears. The short-term MA can also represent resistance to the exchange rate.</p>

<Title>Technical Analysis of Gold and Silver</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>GOLD</h2>
<p>Gold has recorded quite a big drop this week. However, with the price just confirming the double bottom, nothing much has changed in the overall chart. So what key level is there to overcome or break now? Gold is currently situated in this big triangle. From below, we can see strong support at the level of <strong>1677</strong>
 USD. If the price continued further and closed the weekly candle below the <strong>1677</strong>
 USD level, we could consider it bad news as some major correction would be on its way.</p>
<p>From up the price is still held by the trend. Until we overcome it, the gold will not turn bullish. However, as soon as the weekly candle closes over the trend line the gold will turn bullish and its price can continue going up again. With that being said, the space inside the triangle that the price needs to break out of is still large. For now, we will have to wait for the final break.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/GOLD_12_8_506a54079a.png" alt="technical analysis of gold">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Gold on W1 chart</span>
<h2>SILVER</h2>
<p>With a strong support line, silver looks quite similar. And similar to gold, silver must also maintain the level of <strong>21.64</strong>
 USD at all costs on the weekly chart.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we do not have a triangle pattern here, however, we have a bigger channel here. At this point, it is difficult to say whether it is an accumulation and price will go up or on the other hand, it is a distribution and price will go down. Anyway, silver is equally locked in this range between support and resistance levels. If the price were to move, it should overcome the local trend in the first place. However, the price of the second most traded precious metal will not move anywhere until that happens.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Silver on W1 chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This week, we could witness a sharp downward movement on commodities. However, in the bigger picture, it does not mean anything for gold and silver.</p>

<Title>Will the bull market continue?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Bull market</h2>
<p>After a long time BTC broke the range. We are currently testing strong resistance at <strong>$ 47,000</strong>
. However, with this resistance, it can be a struggle. It should not be forgotten that bitcoins have been growing without the usual corrections since the level of 28,000 USD. The crypto "climate" has changed radically in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Still, are we still in danger of a bear scenario? At least it is threatening, but the bear market would be confirmed only at the <strong>new LOW below 28,000 USD.</strong>
</p>
<p>As long as we stay above this level, <strong>the bull market should continue</strong>
.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/investro1_0dda991caf.png" alt="default">
<span class="img-caption">Source:  TradingView</span>
<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>We still keep the trendline on the daily chart and we are under resistance level. In general, the longer we move below the resistance level, the higher the chance of breaking it. From the point of view of technical analysis, it would be ideal if at this price level there was a rejection and a drop through the trendline. It would be ideal not to fall below $ 40,000 and thus maintain the upper edge of the rank and subsequently grow.</p>
<p>If the graph just grows, it does not create any supports on its way up. Support is support only when it is tested.** If we did not test the top edge of this rank at $ 40,000 now, we cannot know how strong this support is**. It would be testing that would show us that BTC will maintain this level and we are ready to go up again.</p>
<p>Of course, this would slow down the whole growth, but from the point of view of technical analysis it would be ideal. Otherwise, something similar to what we witnessed in April may happen to us. <strong>Bitcoin created a minimum of structures and supports on the way from $ 4,000 to $ 64,000</strong>
, which is why it was so extremely difficult to estimate the bottom of the correction, which is why this correction was so strong.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/inestro2_bfa032d266.png" alt="default">
<span class="img-caption">Source: TradingView</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In my opinion, the Bitcoin bull market will continue as long as we stay above the $ 28,000 level. On the contrary, <strong>the level of 47,000 - 49,000 USD is a strong resistance, where I would expect a slowdown in growth</strong>
. However, this slowdown will have no impact on the overall market.</p>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: The biggest hack in history</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>DeFi is recovering from a huge blow - hundreds of millions have disappeared</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency market has been prone to the theft of funds through various hacks since its inception. This is mainly since this is a young industry that is constantly and extremely fast developing. Some applications, <strong>platforms and protocols enter the market without thorough testing</strong>
 and this creates space for attackers. At the same time, we are talking about one of the fastest-growing markets ever, and along with the rise in the prices of individual cryptocurrencies, the motivation of hackers is also rising.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, one of the largest crypto hacks in history took place. <strong>The attacker targeted Poly Network and stole about $ 611 million.</strong>
 We can take this as a record, as a total of $ 550 million disappeared in the biggest hack in 2018. The attack on the Poly Network project is the largest in decentralized finances to date, increasing the total value of stolen funds to $ 1.1 billion this year. This value has already exceeded ten times the total losses caused by hacker attacks last year. The value was distributed between 3 blockchains - Ethereum ($ 273 million), Binance Smart Chain ($ 253 million) and Polygon ($ 85 million).</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/hacker_in_front_of_computer_screen_08c132d7de.jpg" alt="Hacker in front of computer screen">
<span class="img-caption">Hacker in front of the computer screen, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>According to data on the Poly Network website, this is a protocol that is designed to run on multiple blockchains and perform transactions with their decentralized exchanges. They focus on borrowing funds and other services based on stablecoin technology. <strong>The platform interacts with multiple blockchains - Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Ontology, Elrond, Zilliqa</strong>
 and others.</p>
<h2>The hacker claims that the return of funds was planned from the beginning</h2>
<p>The hack took place in a trading pool built in collaboration with O3 Labs, called O3 Swap. According to Igor Igamberdiev from The Block Research, <strong>the main cause of the security breach was a flaw in cryptography,</strong>
 which is quite unusual. The Poly Network team said that after a preliminary investigation of the incident, they managed to discover a vulnerability in their system, which offered the hacker the opportunity.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the hacker managed to successfully transfer the stolen funds, he can enjoy them with big problems. <strong>He tried to "wash" some of them,</strong>
 for example through the Curve protocol and others. However, some of these transactions were unsuccessful as <strong>Tether added USDTs to the blacklist,</strong>
 making them virtually unusable. The hacker was even advised by a member of the community called "Hanashiro.eth" and he received 13.37 ETH worth about $ 42,000 as a reward. This rather strange initiative was subsequently joined by many other people who advise the hacker and refer to him as "Etherhood" in the posts.</p>
<p>The bad news for the attacker is the information that <strong>SlowMist has reported that they can trace his identity and have his email address, IP address and fingerprint.</strong>
 They want to provide the mentioned data and thus contribute to the detection of the hacker. Interestingly, Poly Network was able to contact the hacker through messages recorded in Ethereum transactions. Messages have informed him that his actions will be considered a serious economic crime in every country and will be prosecuted.</p>
<p>It seems that all the mentioned facts took over and to the surprise of all the <strong>hacker responded to the message</strong>
 in the same way. He wrote in his statement that if he moved the remaining shitcoins, it would be a billion-dollar hack. He claims that <strong>his intention was only to reveal the vulnerability</strong>
 and that, in fact, he is not interested in the funds at all. He declared that it was not an inside job and, on the contrary, he wanted to prevent it from similarly stealing by Poly Network or other entities in the future.</p>
<p><strong>The hacker gradually began to return the stolen funds,</strong>
 and Poly Network has already confirmed that most of them have returned. The media report claims that he was offered a reward of $ 500,000 for returning the cryptocurrencies, which he refused. The company also wanted to agree with the attacker on "impunity" in the return of funds, and they were promised that they would not search for his identity. This offer is quite dubious, because the search for criminals is, of course, primarily a matter for law enforcement agencies, and they are certainly not interested in the gentlemen's agreement between the hacker and the Poly Network.</p>

<Excerpt>A hacking attack in which an attacker obtained cryptocurrencies worth hundreds of millions of dollars will eventually have a happy end.</Excerpt>

<Title>Crude Oil (WTI) statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.76%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.96%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.91%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.93%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>-0.94%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently negative (<strong>-2</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-3</strong>
 for price indexation. Therefore, it is currently in the negative phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated development of cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. As we can see in the chart below, only monthly <strong>WTI</strong>
 MA is in bearish sentiment. In the event of a decline, the medium-term MA can be an important price support.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, we have witnessed more upward trends, the maximum level of which has reached <strong>3</strong>
 consecutive days. The maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>8</strong>
 days. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>2</strong>
 days in the same period. However, the maximum decrease was <strong>11</strong>
 days in the measured period. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.40%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>1.88%</strong>
, which confirms the recent decline in True Range. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.60%</strong>
 and <strong>3.60%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>6.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to negative short-term sentiment with a gradual decline since our last analysis. The <strong>WTI</strong>
 is currently very close to a level of around <strong>68.00</strong>
, which was an important resistance this year that has passed to support. However, rising inflation could raise price again. This scenario also supports the divergence between price development and RSI that has developed in recent weeks. The market price is below the short-term moving average. If there is a further decline, the next stop could be the demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
, along with the psychological level of <strong>60.00</strong>
 and the long-term MA.</p>

<Title>Linking Twitter accounts with Bitcoin on the way?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>There is no need to introduce Jack Dorsey. Or is there?</h2>
<p>He is a well-known CEO of one of the largest social networks Twitter and also a mobile payment company Square. This multi-billionaire recently made headlines again as he openly promoted and supported Bitcoin. He said it is a cryptocurrency with unique strength and potential to rule the world. In 2008, he received the "Innovator of the year award" from The Wall Street Journal, which ranked him among the top 35 innovators in the world.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/jack_dorsey_twitter_ceo_33decaef7a.jpg" alt="Jack Dorsey, Twitter CEO">
<span class="img-caption">Jack Dorsey, Twitter CEO, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p><strong>Dorsey is known to be an absolute Bitcoin maximalist,</strong>
 and his statements to other cryptocurrencies cannot be considered very flattering. He even called Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency a possible scam, and with those words, he certainly did not incline its vast community. He completely ruled out speculation about the possible integration of Ethereum NFT e-wallets with Twitter accounts.</p>
<p>Despite his clear focus and "resistance" to other cryptocurrencies, in March this year, he did not hesitate to use the services of the ETH platform and through it, <strong>he sold in the form of NFT his very first tweet with the text "just setting up my twttr".</strong>
 It was posted on March 21, 2006, and was sold as an NFT for $ 2.9 million. This amount later went to the charity GiveDirectly, which supports people living in poverty. <strong>Twitter also released 140 of its own free NFTs,</strong>
 most of which were moving images of the company's logo.</p>
<h2>There was a hot debate on Dorsey's Twitter account</h2>
<p>An interesting debate took place a few days ago in a thread under Dorsey's post. Of course, the number of comments below his posts is nothing special, but this time the CEO of Twitter himself was extremely active in responding. In one of the comments, he <strong>suggested that each Twitter account should be linked to the NFT wallet.</strong>
 Users could then freely select the NFT from their wallet and use them as an avatar for their Twitter account.</p>
<p>Another user responded by saying that a similar feature would be much more beneficial for Ethereum than for Twitter. This means that Twitter has virtually no incentive to take a similar step. In addition, this kind of implementation of Ethereum NTFs could be detrimental to the adoption of Bitcoin, which would run counter to Dorsey's beliefs. <strong>Dorsey responded to the call and said he agreed, but only if it would be linking Twitter accounts to BTC Lightning Wallets.</strong>
</p>

<span class="img-caption">Connection of Bitcoin and Twitter, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<h2>Linking Twitter accounts with fast payments</h2>
<p>The head of Twitter said that every account on his platform should be linked to Bitcoin Lightning Wallet. A similar implementation could be very interesting for Twitter, as it <strong>could bring significant profits to the company.</strong>
 However, it is still unclear whether the platform will actually implement this feature in the coming months. Dorsey also avoided commenting on whether and when that could happen.</p>
<p>The new feature, in the right form, <strong>could bring Bitcoin a truly massive increase in the number of active users.</strong>
 Lightning wallets are designed to offer fast and secure payments. On the platform, this is likely to attract a number of cryptocurrency enthusiasts looking for secure and reliable payment networks to make payments efficiently.</p>

<Title>USD/JPY remains under pressure after Japanese data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What did the data show?</h2>
<p>Traders paid attention to a batch of Japanese data today. The quarterly GDP rose by 0.3% in the second quarter, better than -0.9% in the first quarter. The annualized economic activity roared higher to 1.3%, up from -3.7% previously. However, the third quarter might be a bit different, considering the new measures to curb the spread of the virus in the country.</p>
<p>Additionally, Japanese industrial production also improved and printed 23% for June, followed by the 6.2% number for capacity utilization, way better than -6.8% scored in May. The Yen advanced after these numbers, and it has managed to hold gains throughout the day so far.</p>
<h2>What about US and USD/JPY pair?</h2>
<p>Later in the US session, the New York Empire State manufacturing index for August is seen dropping notably to 29 from 43 in May. On Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment cratered to the lowest level in a decade. Respondents cited soaring inflation and rising house prices as their concerns. The USD dropped afterwards as it might lead to more dovishness by the Fed.</p>
<p>The USDJPY pair is often tightly correlated to US yields, and since US yields appear to have peaked in April/May, the uptrend in the USDJPY pair might be over for now too.</p>
<p>From the technical point of view, the initial support appears to be at 109.30, with the next level of demand near August lows at 108.75. Should the USDJPY pair drop below that support, the medium-term outlook could change to bearish. Alternatively, the resistance remains at the psychological level of 110, where both the 8 and 21-day EMAs are converged, reinforcing the selling pressure.</p>

<Excerpt>The USD/JPY pair was down for the fourth day in a row and was seen 0.3% lower during the London session on Monday, changing hands at around 109.30.</Excerpt>

<Title>EUR/GBP catching some bullish momentum after UK data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What did UK numbers show today?</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, the UK labor market data came above the market expectations, but it seems it was not enough to strengthen the Pound. The unemployment rate improved slightly to 4.8% from 4.7% previously, while the claimant count change rose sharply to -.7,800 from -114,800 previously. Additionally, average earnings continued to rise sharply in the year-on-year comparison. As previously said, the GBP failed to capitalize on these data and was offered, with the GBP/USD pair dropping toward the key support of 1.38.</p>
<p>Data came from the Eurozone as well. The yearly employment change for the second quarter improved notably from -1.8% to 1.8%, and the quarterly change also moved higher. Furthermore, the GDP for the second quarter stayed at 2% QoQ, with the YoY change ticking lower a notch to 13.6%.</p>
<p>The EUR/USD pair rarely reacts to EU data and today was no exception. Therefore, the EUR/GBP could defend its gains for now.</p>
<h2>Can US influence the EUR/GBP pair?</h2>
<p>Later in the day, the US retail sales numbers are due, with market participants forecasting a sharp decline in the monthly comparisons. The drop in consumer confidence to a decade low could be reflected in these retail sales numbers as consumers are hit with soaring inflation. Finally, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is due to speak at an online town hall event. His words will most likely sound dovish, as always, possibly sparking another selling in the USD and volatility in the EUR/GBP cross.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the price dropped below the April lows of 0.84750 to kill stop-losses of long positions. Afterwards, the cross reversed and returned higher, with a possibly bullish reversal in play. The price is now testing an important bearish trendline at 0.8535, and if broken to the upside, the short-term outlook could change to bullish.</p>
<p>The next target for bulls could be at 0.8610. at the same time, the first stronger resistance is expected at July's highs at 0.8670. Alternatively, if the euro starts to decline again, the first support is seen at 0.84750 again, before the current cycle lows at 0.8450. Should the common currency drop below 0.8450, the long-term downtrend would be confirmed, possibly leading to further selling.</p>

<p>Since our last analysis, there has been more downward pressure, where we have seen a maximum of <strong>6</strong>
 consecutive days. The highest decrease in the measured period was <strong>9</strong>
 days. However, upward trends in the last week were dominated by <strong>4</strong>

<p>The basic technical analysis supports bullish sentiment after the dynamic upward movements in mid-June and early August. The divergence between the market price and the RSI supports this scenario. Volumes slow down from the last peak (red ellipse). <strong>USD/CHF</strong>
 is currently close to the demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
, along with the long-term moving average and the psychological level of <strong>0.9000</strong>
. Today, the short-term moving average acts as a resistance.</p>

<Title>Investro Tea: Week #33</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Two sides of pandemic</h2>
<p>Companies Pfizer and BioNTech have officially started a formal process of approval of the booster shot of Covid-19 with FDA and showed data that proved that the third jab of vaccine increases the level of antidotes against the Beta and Delta variants. While the whole world has not yet finished the first wave of vaccination,  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-biontech-seek-fda-clearance-for-covid-19-booster-11629136057">the second wave is probably approaching as well.</a>
</p>
<p>WSJ also informs that the retail sales in the USA dropped by 1,1% due to the spread of new Delta variant.</p>
<p>Roblox, a company behind the creation of Roblox - an online platform popular amongst kids, has fallen in the share price due to the lower than expected sales for Q2. The share price of the company has fallen after hours by almost 6% as a reaction to the release of Q2 information of Roblox. If you want to know more about this company, feel free <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-16/roblox-falls-after-quarterly-bookings-miss-wall-street-estimates">to follow this link.</a>
</p>
<p>The views on the pandemic are therefore twofold. On the one hand there are new vaccines getting ready for better protection of the population. On the other hand, the fears of the third wave are spreading and so is Delta variant, which causes retail sales to drop and affects even companies such as Roblox, which were during the pandemic a source of entertainment. We will definitely keep you updated on this very complex matter.</p>

<h2>News from the crypto world</h2>
<p>Coindesk.com shows that currently major crypto funds are experiencing an outflow of funds. Only this week this figure got as high as 22,1 million dollars. Moreover, this is a 6th week in a row where cryptocurrency fonds are experiencing outflows, which is <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-funds-6th-week-of-outflows">the longest run of this type ever since January 2018 </a>
. However, the overall AUM of investment products in digital assets increased by 10 % to over 55 billion dollars. This is though mainly thanks to the increase in the prices of the cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In regards with crypto, one of the questions that we asked (and also tried to answer) is whether Twitter, one of the biggest social media networks, will allow for Bitcoin Lightning payments directly in their infrastructure. Are those only rumours or reality? You can see our take on this matter <a href="https://investro.com/crypto/linking-twitter-accounts-with-bitcoin-on-the-way">in this article.</a>

<Title>US indices remain bullish, FOMC minutes eyed</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The medium and long-term uptrends remain intact, but the short-term situation is unclear as indices fail to post new highs, which is often needed to confirm the bullish momentum. Later in the day, US building permits are expected to post a marginal increase to 1.61 million from 1.594 million previously, while housing starts will most likely decline, from 1.643 million to 1.6 million. Soaring home prices have led to record optimism in the housing building sector, but on the other hand, the higher the prices go, the less demand from consumers.</p>
<h2>FOMC minutes under scrutiny</h2>
<p>Afterward, the focus of market participants will shift to the FOMC minutes from July's decision. Equity bulls are hoping for a dovish tilt. However, it looks like the Fed will be required to taper its QE program sooner rather than later, mainly due to the soaring inflation. Economists at MUFG noted on Wednesday that:</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/us_stocks_aa41584058.jpg" alt="US Stocks">
<span class="img-caption">US Stocks, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<span class="quote-author">“The US economy is continuing to recover strongly with employment growth picking up in recent months. It leaves the Fed on course to make a QE taper announcement before the end of this year.”
</span>
<p>Should there be a hawkish surprise in the minutes, we could see a decline in US indices. But overall, it seems that equity markets have not been pricing in any monetary policy tightening at all.  Judging by the US yields, the market has given up hopes for tightening as yields have peaked in April and have moved notably lower since then.</p>
<h2>Technical situation still bullish</h2>
<p>The Nasdaq 100 index tested its 21-day Exponential Moving Average, which tends to be stronger support sometimes. So far, the price is bouncing off that level, and the short-term outlook seems bullish. The index has been consolidating in a triangle pattern, and volatility has declined, which is usual for this type of consolidation. However, the market is getting ready to explode from the triangle, and the direction could be set after today's FOMC minutes.</p>
<p>Initial resistance is now found at the upper line of the triangle near 15,130 USD. If the price jumps above it, the next target is at the current cycle highs of 15,200 USD. The medium-term target remains at 16,000 USD. Alternatively, if a breakdown from the triangle occurs, the next support could be found at 14,800 USD, before 14,600 USD. The bearish scenario could be reinforced by the negative divergence between the MACD indicator and the price.</p>

<Title>Dollar index on a rise, while others fall</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>DXY</h2>
<p>If we look at the global situation, it is highly probable that DXY has found its bottom and might be heading higher. Theoretically, it has already created a higher LOW which might now lead to a "fight" for a higher HIGH. The increasing power of US dollar is also visible when looking at other indices, which are slowly losing ground.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/o_NOIOI_Re_58968983a1.png" alt="DXY Weekly chart">
<span class="img-caption">DXY Weekly chart, Source: Author´s analysis</span>
<p>The daily chart shows that we were able to break the trendline to the upside and create a new HIGH. This trendline was in essence the last option for triangle to be formed. But right now, it is very possible that we are going to "attack" values of 94.31 - 94.75, where we might be slowly forming a double top. If we however break this trendline it is possible that the stock markets might be heading into correction.</p>

<span class="img-caption">DXY Daily chart, Source: Author´s analysis</span>
<h2>S&P 500</h2>
<p>When looking at S&P 500, we see nothing new. To be honest, it again looks completely the same with the slight rise of the levels inside the channel. Even if any correction comes, it is possible that it will jump back from the trendline and quickly rise back to the previous levels. This is an ongoing "battle" which has been visible for almost 9 months. We might even say, that this is a situation, to which we are now accustomed, however, it might be a bit dangerous. If DXY shows strength, I would really consider an option of S&P 500 going into correction. Even the situation now looks a bit on the edge. In my view, I thought that the correction would come during the summer time, but we are not witnessing any of that yet. The red flags are however increasing in numbers, which should lead to more caution by traders.</p>

<span class="img-caption">S&P 500 Weekly Chart, Source: Author´s analysis</span>
<h2>Concluding remarks</h2>
<p>The fact that correction might come is at this stage only a fear or a theory. However, if the trendline on S&P 500 breaks down, the fall can be really fast and harmful. The red flags are increasing in numbers for now, and DXY is one of them. Yet, if the trendline holds, we should be fine for the short term future.</p>

<Excerpt>Today we are going to take a closer look on a Dollar Index (DXY), which we will later on compare also with S&P 500. What differences or similarities can be spotted there?</Excerpt>

<Title>Can Bitcoin finally break 50 000 dollars?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Daily chart - huge growth that needs correction</h2>
<p>The look at a daily chart is rather boring. We have come to test probably the strongest resistance there is. Bitcoin managed to come to test this resistance almost in one upwards movement from the level of 28 000 dollars, which is now supported by a trendline.</p>
<p>Even when BTC fell in May, I was saying that bull market is not over and it will continue. I still also believe that we will see new ATH this year, but from technical point of view, it would be appropriate for Bitcoin to take a bit of a breather and have a correction. The cryptocurrencies however show a behaviour pattern, in which the longer they test the resistance, the higher the chance of breaking it. One might ask why is that so? The explanation is rather simple.</p>
<p>Resistance is a historical level, where the price used to react in the past. The strength of resistance is only seen by the look at the orderbooks. Resistance is thus formed by the historical levels, yet it is important to know that the strength of it is given by the amount of the sell volume that is visible at the given resistance. If the chart therefore comes to the resistance, and the price is not falling, that means that there are no sell orders, which indicates, that it is only a matter of time until the price breaks above. This is exactly what we might be looking at with Bitcoin now.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin daily chart, Source: Author´s analysis</span>
<h2>4h chart - nothing is decided</h2>
<p>The 4-hour chart is rather indecisive as well. We can still be in ABC correction where, if the trendline is broken, we can see bigger correction move. It is important to note that the longer Bitcoin rises on the trendline without any significant correction, the worse will be the correction after the trendline is broken. It will be also really difficult to find a reasonable support, if that happens.</p>
<p>In my opinion, everything now depends on the orderbooks, especially selling pressure. If there is not enough sell orders and no sell walls are created, we might be able to see an upward break of this level fairly soon.</p>

<span class="img-caption">4-hour chart of Bitcoin, Source: Author´s analysis</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, I am very bullish about Bitcoin for the next year or so. I also do believe in new ATH either at the end of this year or at the beginning of the next one. However, the speed of growth in the last 4 weeks is really high and we are approaching really significant resistance. The chart has to stop somewhere to correct a bit, and this looks like the most reasonable place. Yet, the sell orders are not there, which really decreases the chances for a more significant correction.</p>

<Excerpt>That is one of the most important questions in crypto world right now. Bitcoin is growing almost constantly from the level of 28 000 dollars and does not seem to be stopping. Can it however break 50 000 dollars? Which levels are important for the biggest cryptocurrency to do so?</Excerpt>

<Title>XPD/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.47%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.53%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.75%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.70%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>-1.61%</strong>
, which is below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. It is currently in an extremely declining phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210820_cycles_c46a06d164.jpg" alt="XPD/USD daily price indexation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. The price of <strong>XPD/USD</strong>
 has decreased in the last month. Therefore, all MAs support bearish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210820_Mo_M_176b77b0d8.jpg" alt="XPD/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, we have witnessed more declining trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>4</strong>
 consecutive days. The total maximum in the measured period (last 3 years) is <strong>5</strong>
 days. The upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. However, the maximum in the measured period is <strong>14</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.08%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>4.41%</strong>
, which is significantly above average as the volatility rises. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.0%</strong>
 and <strong>3.0%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>5.25%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to volatile development since the beginning of this year. Two short-term dynamic corrections brought the price to an important zone. <strong>XPD/USD</strong>
 is currently below both moving averages. However, it is in the long-term demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50%</strong>
. In addition, a positive scenario could be supported by a divergence between the price development and the RSI. A further drop below the zone could be critical for the bulls.</p>

<Title>GBP/USD bounces as dollar retreats</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Sterling advanced on Monday and capitalized on a weaker dollar, with the GBP/USD pair trading 0.45% higher during the London session, changing hands at around 1.36750.</p>
<p>The greenback has been down against most of its major peers, and the dollar index dropped some 0.20% to trade near 93.30.</p>
<h2>Manufacturing stays strong, services weaken</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, traders paid attention to the UK PMIs. The manufacturing sector ticked lower but came out above market expectations and printed 60.1, versus 60.4 previously. However, the services PMI dropped notably to six-month lows of 55.5 from 59.6 in July. The services sector is usually more important for the overall economy, and it appears a bigger slowdown is ahead. Nevertheless, the Pound failed to react in a bearish way and stayed elevated.</p>
<span class="post-quote">Although the PMI indicates that the economy continues to expand at a pace slightly above the pre-pandemic average, there are clear signs of the recovery losing momentum in the third quarter after a buoyant second quarter.

<h2>US data in focus now</h2>
<p>A batch of US data will be released later in the day. The Markit manufacturing PMI for August is seen slowing slightly to 62.8 from 63.4 previously, while the services sector should slow to 59.4. In addition, the final composite PMI is expected to decline modestly to58.3 from 59.9 previously.</p>
<p>Additionally, existing home sales are forecast to rise 1.3% month-on-month to 5.81 million units.</p>
<h2>Jackson Hole Symposium takes center stage</h2>
<p>Volatility is expected to gradually increase over the next few days as the much-expected Jackson Hole Symposium starts on Thursday. The market wants Jay Powell to announce tapering, and it appears he will need to do so. Therefore, the USD might accelerate higher on Thursday, but at the moment, the wait-and-see approach might be the best strategy.</p>
<h2>Cable defending major support</h2>
<p>From the technical point of view, the pair has managed to defend the key support of 1.36, and it is now forming a double bottom pattern. As long as the price remains above 1.36, the short-term outlook appears bullish.</p>
<p>If the Pound drops below 1.36, large stop-losses of long positions will be hit, most likely sending the pair immediately to 1.35.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the resistance is spotted near previous lows at 1.3790, and cable needs to get back above it to turn the medium-term outlook from bearish to neutral.</p>

<Title>Visa and PayPal released bullish cryptonews</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Visa and NFT craze</h2>
<p>Only few hours ago, we informed that Visa has bought its first NFT for almost 150 000 dollars. This step of one of the payment conglomerates was only announced in the morning via official Twitter account of the company. Visa has specified that it bought NFT CryptoPunks #7610, which is one of the 3 840 female punks in the 10 000 collection set of Larva Labs made in 2017. The company has paid 49.5 ETH for this NFT.</p>
<p>According to Cuy Sheffield, head of the crypto Visa division, this step should be seen on many different levels. First and foremost, this purchase was done in order to expand the collection of Visa, which can be viewed as an evolution of the financial system. It already has such pieces, machines or artefacts like paper credit cards or zip-zap machines. Sheffield believes that this NFT is a great piece to have in collection like this.</p>
<span class="post-quote">"We felt that CryptoPunks would be a great addition to our collection of artefacts that can chart and celebrate the past, present, and future of commerce."</span>
<span class="quote-author">Cuy Sheffield, Head of Crypto division in Visa</span>
<p>More importantly, Visa decided to do this step to try by itself, what the process of buying an NFT looks like. This is because Visa believes that NFTs are the future and therefore, this company wants to be able to help customers and companies on their journey in the NFT world. To be able to do so, Visa must have its own experience with NFTs, which it now has. This is, however, a bit questionable, since Visa has not bought the NFT itself. Visa has used one of its partners, Anchorage Digital, to do so. The company only handed fiat to Anchorage Digital, which not only bought the NFT, but is also now storing it and has it in custody. Thus, it is yet to be seen, what Visa actually learned from this purchase.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/visa_crypto_linked_payment_card_e9b69cf38c.jpg" alt="VISA crypto-linked payment card">
<span class="img-caption">Visa and its crypto-plans</span>
<h2>PayPal is taking a different route</h2>
<p>While Visa has jumped onto the NFT bandwagon, one of its competitors, PayPal, has chosen a different strategy. And that is to expand its cryptocurrency services to more countries. Until now, only PayPal users from United States could have bought cryptocurrencies directly on the platform. That changed today, since PayPal has announced that it is now offering the option to buy cryptocurrencies also to its UK users. They will therefore have the opportunity to buy Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum or Bitcoin Cash directly in the app or on the website for as little as 1 dollar.</p>
<p>PayPal estimates that it has over 2 million monthly users in the United Kingdom, which is a reason why PayPal is "tackling" the adoption of cryptocurrency services in the Europe through one of its strongest countries.  However, while lot has changed for PayPal and its users in the past year, one crucial change has not been done yet. And that is the change of actually buying and owning cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Since you can not withdraw cryptocurrency from the platform, you do not actually own cryptocurrencies, only their derivatives. That means that since you are not the owner of the private keys to any given cryptocurrencies, you are only holding a speculative investment asset, not a cryptocurrency. While this might be sufficient for traders who are speculating on the volatility of the underlying assets, long term investors or hodlers should not buy or hodl through this platform since they can not withdraw they cryptocurrencies to cold wallets.</p>

<Excerpt>Both Visa and Paypal have just released interesting news towards the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Their approach is however different.</Excerpt>

<Title>Kiwi trades back above strong support</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, traders bought the New Zealand dollar, also known as the Kiwi, and it managed to rise back above the critical support of 0.69 in the European trading session. Overall, it looks like commodities will continue in their gains, likely supporting commodity currencies as the mood in the markets remains positive.</p>
<h2>New Zealand data strengthened NZD</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, New Zealand retail sales for the second quarter jumped more than expected and beat expectations, rising to 3.3% quarter-on-quarter, up from 2.8% in the year's first quarter. Retail sales ex-autos soared from 6.6% to 33.3%. However, since New Zealand is locked down again for a couple of days/weeks, retail sales will most likely deteriorate notably during this quarter.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the NZD/USD pair managed to make pretty gains as it traded half a percent stronger during the London session, rising above 0.6930. Traders will also focus on the trade balance figure from New Zealand, due later tonight. As a result, volatility might be elevated again.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/nzdusd_58ab52f0c3.jpg" alt="NZD/USD exchange rate">
<span class="img-caption">NZD/USD exchange rate</span>
<span class="post-quote">"The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) remains on track to begin its tightening cycle as early as this October amid COVID-19 lockdown and rising house price inflation."</span>
<span class="quote-author">The central bank's Deputy Governor Geoff Bascand said in an interview with MNI on Tuesday. </span>
<p>Somewhat hawkish comments from Bascand helped to support the NZD against the USD. The US calendar offers only new home sales for July today, expected to improve marginally to 0.69 million.</p>
<h2>Technical situation remains unclear</h2>
<p>The Kiwi dropped below the previous strong support of 0.69, cleared out stop-losses of long positions, and marched back above that level. It is usually considered a bullish signal when this happens since the breakdown to new lows was only a false one.</p>
<p>Therefore, as long as the NZDUSD pair trades above the 0.69 level, the short-term outlook seems bullish, targeting the next resistance at 0.6950, where the 21-day exponential moving average is. If that area is breached to the upside, the next level to watch stands at 0.70. There is also a notable bullish divergence between the MACD indicator and the price, supporting the bullish bounce for now.</p>
<p>On Monday, the greenback lost ground as investors sold it notably ahead of the Jackson Hole Symposium, starting Thursday. Since some of the macro data came out weaker than expected lately, investors now speculate that the tapering won't start as soon as previously thought, possibly undermining the US dollar against other currencies.</p>

<Title>EUR/USD flat ahead of durable goods data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Volatility has been minimal on Wednesday, and the EUR/USD pair was seen unchanged ahead of the US session, expecting some important data later in the day.</p>
<h2>Hawkish ECB failed to support euro</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, the European Central Bank (ECB) Vice President Luis de Guindos said that <strong>the central bank could improve some macroeconomic projections for the Eurozone in a few days</strong>
. Additionally, he added that third-quarter indicators look positive. However, despite his bullish/hawkish comments, the EURUSD pair failed to move and remained stuck near 1.1750.</p>
<h2>German data weaker than expected</h2>
<p>Additionally, German IFO disappointed, and <strong>the expectations gauge dropped notably to 97.5 in August, down from 101 previously</strong>
, while the business climate subindex declined from 100.7 to 99.4. The current assessment, as the least important of those three, improved to 101.4 from 100.4 earlier.</p>
<span class="post-quote">70% of industrial businesses complain about supply chain bottlenecks. Also, export expectations have fallen but remain at a relatively good level. Two-thirds of companies in both manufacturing and retail sectors want higher prices to cover rising costs. Rising covid-19 infections have dampened expectations in tourism and hospitality. 
</span>
<span class="quote-author">The IFO’s Economist Klaus Wohlrabe said after the data.</span>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/eur_usd_14c598efbb.jpg" alt="EURUSD exchange rate">
<h2>US number in focus now</h2>
<p>Later in the day, US durable goods orders will be released. <strong>Investors expect the gauge to drop notably, from 0.9% to -0.3% on a monthly basis</strong>
, while the capital goods orders indicator is forecast to slow to 0.5% from 0.7% previously. Weaker data might undermine the USD, but volatility should not be elevated until Friday, when Jay Powell will talk about tapering.</p>
<p>Should he fail to announce the start of tapering, i.e., sound dovish, the USD will most likely decline sharply. On the other hand, if he actually announces the start of tapering, it could be a bullish impetus for the dollar.</p>
<h2>Technically, EURUSD looks bullish</h2>
<p>The daily chart of the EURUSD pair is starting to look very bullish as the pair has formed a massive falling wedge pattern, which is a bullish reversal formation. The wedge is also supported by a substantial divergence between the price and the indicator.</p>
<p>Should the euro start rallying, <strong>the 1.18 seems like the next target, and breaking above would make the wedge pattern valid.</strong>
  The full potential of the formation could be in the 1.21 region, but on the way there, there are two strong selling zones: 1.19 and 1.20.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the bearish pressure reappears, the support might be located at 1.17 and afterward at the current cycle lows of 1.1650. Should the euro break below 1.1650, the long-term downtrend would be confirmed.</p>

<Title>Investro Tea: Week #34</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The global shortage of semiconductors is expected to reduce global car production by up to 7.1 million vehicles this year. The shortage of chips is likely to stabilize in the second quarter of next year, and the industry will not recover until the second half of the year, according to IHS Markit. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/chip-crisis-threatens-to-cut-auto-output-by-7-1-million-cars&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1629908037034000&usg=AOvVaw2xNZMC5JBR776_M9c9t-RI">You can read more about it on Bloomberg</a>
.</p>
<h2>If there is a company not affected by the microchip shortage then it is Boeing.</h2>
<p>Boeing has pledged to invest in Richard Branson's Virgin Orbit as part of the company's $ 3.2 billion listings. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/boeing-plans-investment-in-virgin-orbits-3-2-billion-spac-listing-11629713303">You can read more at WSJ</a>
.</p>
<p>For those who might be wondering, Richard Branson is a billionaire and a founder of Virgin Galactic company, with which he personally visited Earth’s orbit for the first time in July this year. He managed to conquer space before Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, his rival “space entrepreneurs”.</p>
<p>Although Jeff Bezos has officially left the management of Amazon, the company did not stop working without him. On the contrary, it continues to grow and currently prepares a number of innovations. At this point, Amazon plans to open several large “brick and mortar” stores to sell clothing, household goods, and others. With Amazon already running the Amazon Fresh grocery store chain, the question remains - Will this company’s new business endeavors thrive despite the tough competition of large supermarkets? <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-retail-department-stores-11629330842">You can read more about it here</a>

<p>After a long time, Bitcoin again exceeded the $ 50,000 mark, which is the highest value since May 15, but fell below shortly after.</p>
<p>Bitcoin yields since the beginning of the year are now at 70% and other cryptocurrencies in the top twenty are still growing. After all, we wrote about exceeding $ 50,000 a few days ago in <a href="https://investro.com/crypto/can-bitcoin-finally-break-50-000-dollars">our article</a>

<Title>USD/CAD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.41%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.41%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.20%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.20%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was only <strong>-0.50%</strong>
, which is close to the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-1</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in a slightly negative phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the **6 months **and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to the short-term and medium-term MAs, <strong>USD/CAD</strong>
 is in bullish sentiment. In the event of further growth, the annual MA could be an important resistance for the exchange rate.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>There have been more upward trends since our last analysis, with a maximum of <strong>3</strong>
 days. The maximum in the measured period is <strong>7</strong>
 days. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>2</strong>
 days in the same period. However, the maximum in the measured period is <strong>5</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.69%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.58%</strong>
, which is almost the same. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-0.90%</strong>
 and <strong>0.90%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>Basic technical analysis supports short-term bearish sentiment, as the exchange rate declined into the demand zone (green rectangle), where are also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
, the psychological level of <strong>1.2600</strong>
 and currently also the short-term and long-term moving averages. In the long run, the exchange rate is still on a declining trend. We also see divergence between the market price and the RSI that have arisen over the last month. In the case of further growth above the zone, the psychological level of <strong>1.3000</strong>
 could be an important resistance. If the pair corrects, <strong>1.2300</strong>
 could be support.</p>

<Title>Gold looks indecisive, drops back below 1,800 USD</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, the bullion was down for three consecutive days, changing hands near 1,785 USD as sentiment worsened ahead of US data and Jay Powell's critical speech.</p>
<h2>US data likely ignored due to Jackson Hole buzz</h2>
<p>Later today, U<strong>S initial jobless claims are expected to remain near last week's 348,000.</strong>
 However, continuing claims will most likely drop (i.e., improve) to 2.79 million.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the US GDP for the second quarter is due, and <strong>it is expected to rise slightly to 6.7% annualized, up from 6.5% in the previous quarter.</strong>
 The GDP price index will also be released and should show massive inflation of circa 6%.</p>
<h2>Powell speaks tomorrow, but volatility will most likely rise today</h2>
<p>After that, the focus of traders and investors will switch to the Jackson Hole Symposium, starting today, although only in a virtual regime. <strong>Volatility will indeed be elevated across the financial markets as many central bankers will hold speeches today and tomorrow</strong>
. Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak on Friday.</p>
<span class="post-quote">"We expect that the Fed will announce tapering at the September FOMC meeting and that tapering will begin in Q4. We expect that tapering will be concluded in summer 2022 followed by a rate hike late 2022." </span>
<span class="quote-author">economists at Danske Bank said in a note on Thursday.</span>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/Gold_1df0200c2a.jpg" alt="XAU/USD example of bars">
<p>For instance, the "official" consensus of market participants is that Jerome Powell will announce the plan to reduce asset purchases on Friday during his remarks. Still, the beginning is expected to start in November. <strong>Therefore, Danske Bank is one of the more hawkish forecasters heading into Friday's Powell speech.</strong>
</p>
<p>Should this hawkish surprise happen, the USD might start appreciating after September's meeting, most likely sending precious metals further lower. On the other hand, if Jerome Powell fails to announce the plan to taper, we could see a massive squeeze in metals' prices.</p>
<h2>Technical situation points to further consolidation</h2>
<p>Gold's failure to defend the 1,800 USD threshold might cause some nerves among the bullish camp. However, <strong>despite the recent volatility (sell-offs and strong rallies), the price has not moved anywhere since the beginning of July, pointing to indecision in the market.</strong>
</p>
<p>Additionally, the long-term trend appears unclear, too, as gold is at last summer levels near 1,780 USD.</p>
<p>The Jackson Hole's outcome will influence short-term trading, and at this time, it is impossible to say what will happen. However, the 200-day moving average is seen near 1,810 USD, and it has been defended by bears, causing a more substantial sell-off recently. Thus, as long as the metal remains below the 200-DMA, the outlook favors selling rallies.</p>
<p><strong>Another resistance is spotted near 1,830 USD, where gold has failed twice already.</strong>
 However, the medium-term trend could improve and turn cautiously bullish should the price rise above this level.</p>
<p>On the downside, the next demand zone could be located near the 1,775 USD, and if not held, further decline toward 1,750 – 1,760 USD seems likely.</p>

<Title>Technical Analysis of US Bonds</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Let’s start with a bit of theory.</h2>
<p>What does the bond chart actually tell us? There are certain general laws in economics. You have probably heard that stocks and indices are growing during times of economic prosperity while gold and silver are not. You might have also heard that precious metals grow in value and are frequently sought upon in times of crises as investors look for a so-called “safe haven”.</p>
<p>With bonds, it is a similar scenario. Especially with the ones owned by the state. There is a dogma about government bonds that it is one of the safest investments. Of course, you cannot expect the interest rates on these bonds not to be anything other than conservative.</p>
<p>So whenever there is an increased interest in government bonds from the side of investors, we can assume that they are looking for a safer investment option. Or they no longer trust the growth of shares and want to protect their assets. These are the very rudimental economy rules. So now, let's put theory aside and look at what the chart of 20-year US bonds looks like.</p>
<h2>Chart</h2>
<p>As for the chart, we can see that there is a kind of triangle on the weekly chart. Overcoming the trend line which acts as resistance will be key here. Ever since <strong>15. 03. 2021</strong>
, the bonds are growing and are currently on the trend lines. If we look at the economy and individual stocks or indices, we already see several factors of “overheating”.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/US_bonds_29a12c6aaf.png" alt="US bonds weekly chart">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: US bonds weekly chart</span>
<p>This bond chart combined with the dollar index chart / DXY / could be the first to indicate to us that a turnaround may be approaching in the economy. The most important thing in this chart is the trend line. If the bonds can break through it, then it means that a lot of investors are just going to invest in something "safer" and it may mean that a correction is approaching traditional markets.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Bonds are just one of several indicators, but last week we addressed the growth of DXY, so if several such important factors come together, things could start to be dangerous.</p>

<Title>USD/JPY awaits Powell's remarks above 110</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>There have not been any significant movements today in the FX market. The USDJPY pair was trading flat ahead of the US session; last spotted some pips above the psychological 110 hurdle.
Everyone is taking a break ahead of today's highly anticipated Jackson Hole Symposium speeches.</p>
<h2>Powell in center of attention</h2>
<p><strong>Today's critical event starts at 4 PM CET when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks about the economic outlook and monetary policy at the Jackson Hole Economic</strong>
 Policy Symposium. In addition, Powell is expected to offer guidance on when is the central bank ready to start tapering its massive QE program.</p>
<p>The official consensus calls for the start of tapering in November. Therefore, if Powell turns dovish and refrains from stating the official tapering date, it could be a piece of very negative news for the USD. Alternatively, if he confirms November, or possibly September, it might send the greenback sharply higher.</p>
<p><strong>Volatility will most likely be highly elevated</strong>
. Thus, traders should avoid the initial spikes up and down and wait for the situation to become more apparent.</p>
<span class="post-quote">USD/JPY has, in 2021, reverted to closely tracking interest rate differentials, notably the 2y2y rate spread. At the very least, that's a warning that if the Fed is successful in escaping the zero-rate bound (and Japan isn't), USD/JPY could be in for a break higher.</span>
<span class="quote-author">Kit Juckes, Chief Global FX Strategist at Société Générale said on Friday.</span>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/usdjpy_1d535b3fa8.jpg" alt="USD/JPY exchange rate">
<h2>Thursday's hawkishness by Bullard</h2>
<p>On Thursday, **Jim Bullard told CNBC that The Fed should "get going" on the taper and that he expects it to end its bond purchase scheme by Q1 2022.**Bullard also noted that "getting taper done early gives the Fed options on raising rates." Lastly, Bullard stated that "financial stability concerns are a good reason to taper."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the USD/JPY pair failed to capitalize on those comments and slipped below the critical 110 level.</p>
<p><strong>The US calendar will offer personal income and spending figures, along with the PCE inflation indices.</strong>
 Lastly, the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index will be released, but it will only revise the previously published number earlier in the month.</p>
<h2>Technically speaking, boredom continues</h2>
<p>From the technical point of view, nothing new has happened here. The pair has not moved anywhere in the last six months, and volatility has been steadily declining.</p>
<p><strong>The initial resistance could be found at the short-term downtrend line, currently at 110.25</strong>
, and if the price jumps above it, a bullish momentum might accelerate. However, the area near 111 has been unbreakable by bulls, and therefore it remains the primary resistance. Only a successful break above July's highs of 111.50 could lead to a notable leg higher above 112.</p>
<p>On the downside, if today's Powell speech disappoints traders, <strong>It seems that the vital support lies at 109, where the recent declines have stopped.</strong>
 Should the dollar drop below 109, the medium-term could change to bearish, possibly leading to a test of the 200-day moving average near 108.</p>

<Title>Technical analysis of Bitcoin: Is this a beginning of a bigger correction?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The candle has already closed under the trend on the daily chart. Does this confirm a breakdown? Unfortunately not yet. With Bitcoin, we have 2 break options. Either a “brutal bomb” will come along which will break everything leaving no space for doubt that a break has occurred. Or, on the contrary, the breakout will be very tight. In this case, I follow my own personal rule - to wait for at least 24 hours for both sides to act. This means that since yesterday’s candle was closed under the trend, it leaves me with no other choice than to give the bulls a chance to push the price up again. If their attempt will be unsuccessful, there is a substantial chance that the correction will continue.</p>
<h2>Where to look for rebounds?</h2>
<p>Since we have already mentioned that it is not certain whether the correction is confirmed or not, it is a bit more difficult to identify targets properly. However, my priority target for now is $ 42,526 - $ 43,870. It is a strong swing value and at the same time, it is 0.382 fibo retracement of the whole cycle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Bitcoin on a daily chart</span>
<h2>Has the decline stopped?</h2>
<p>In conclusion, one more question may occur to you, has the decline stopped already? I personally think that it has not. Because if we are witnessing a correction, then this decline is just the beginning. Every time a correction takes place, we always have two options. Either it will not be deep and it will rather take shape of consolidation (for example in a triangle) or a classic ABC correction will take place, going a bit deeper than the triangle.</p>
<p>However, if the correction is confirmed, this is only the beginning of a bigger decline.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Last week, I expressed my concern that the growth we are currently witnessing on the chart is already ripe for a correction. However, if you look at the history of Bitcoin’s price, there is a slump every September. And this had happened in the last 4 consecutive years.</Excerpt>

<Title>XPT/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.03%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.08%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.53%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.51%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>2.90%</strong>
, which is exactly the second standard deviation. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>2</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>1</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. Indexation is currently in a growing phase of the cycle. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. For all MAs, <strong>XPT/USD</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment. However, the monthly MA could be the first resistance for the market price.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210828_cycles_89bc322361.jpg" alt="XPT/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, we have witnessed higher upward trends, even though the price is lower. They did not exceed <strong>4</strong>
 days. The total maximum in the measured period (last 3 years) is <strong>6</strong>
 days. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. The total maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>7</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.33%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>3.21%</strong>
, which is very close to the average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-2.40%</strong>
 and <strong>2.40%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>3.60%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the basic technical analysis has supported bearish sentiment as the price of the commodity is creating lower lows and lower highs. The medium-term outlook is more positive. Yesterday, <strong>XPT/USD</strong>
 bounced off an important area, where are the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50.00%</strong>
 and the psychological level of <strong>1 000.00</strong>
. The divergence between price development and the RSI also supports the bullish scenario.</p>

<Excerpt>This commodity has been trading in an important area for the last month. The current price of XPT/USD – Platinum Spot US Dollar is 1 007.76 (August 27, 2021). Let us therefore now turn to statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>DeFi Sunday: The SEC is trying to understand decentralized finances</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>The SEC will shed light on the DeFi industry</h2>
<p>A spokesman of AnChain.AI confirmed to Forbes that they have entered into an <strong>agreement with the US federal regulator SEC.</strong>
 The agreement assumes that the contract can be extended for up to 5 years and the SEC will pay a total of $ 625,000 ($ 125,000 per year) for this cooperation. The SEC reportedly wants to understand what is happening in the world of decentralized finances and AnChain.AI will provide them with technology to analyze and track smart contracts.</p>

<span class="img-caption">DeFi concept, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>The collaboration between the U.S. government agency and a private blockchain company comes after recent statements by SEC Chair <strong>Gary Gensler. He said that DeFi projects should be registered with their agency,</strong>
 as he said they were highly centralized in some aspects. Companies involved in this sector should present their team, which would then fall within the SEC's regulatory framework. This month, SEC accused two Florida men and their companies in the Cayman Islands of selling more than $ 30 million in unregistered securities through smart contracts and DeFi technology.</p>
<span class="post-quote">“There’s still a core group of folks that are not only writing the software, like the open-source software, but they often have governance and fees… There’s some incentive structure for those promoters and sponsors in the middle of this.”</span>
<span class="quote-author">Gary Gensler, SEC chair</span>
<p><strong>AnChain.AI is a recognized blockchain analytical company</strong>
 that, among other things, monitors illegal crypto transactions on exchanges and also in DeFi protocols. The new agreement has certainly made an interesting financial improvement, and the cryptocurrency community certainly hopes that thanks to their data, SEC will reach quality regulatory solutions.</p>
<h2>The popularity of DeFi is growing and the regulator should make sure that the rules do not unnecessarily slow down the game</h2>
<p><strong>SEC appears to be intensely focused on the DeFi</strong>
 industry and individual projects. Among other things, they would like to obtain data on all Proof-of-Stake token holders, which is of course almost impossible due to anonymity in decentralized finances. It is the DeFi company that has direct contact with the blockchain that could help the SEC understand these innovative technologies.</p>
<p>DeFi has gained great popularity in recent years and has become a multi-billion dollar business. <strong>We are currently talking about a value above $ 82 billion,</strong>
 with the largest exchange, Uniswap, processing transactions with a daily volume of more than 1 billion. This adoption is led mainly by experienced crypto traders and investors. This is also reflected in the fact that DeFi adoption is more visible in higher-wage countries. This is data from a survey by Chainalysis, which deals with blockchain analysis.</p>
<p>The company's findings are based on its global DeFi adoption index in 2021, which evaluates up to 154 countries. The USA, Vietnam, Thailand, China, the United Kingdom, India, the Netherlands, Canada, Ukraine and Poland reached the top ten.</p>

<Title>EUR/USD attacks 1.18 as dovish Powell sparks a powerful rally</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Traders continued to sell the greenback on Monday, following the large Friday's drop, and the EUR/USD pair was trying to rise above the important 1.18 threshold.</p>
<p>The dollar dived on Friday as <strong>Jerome Powell failed to announce the starting month for the long-anticipated tapering process.</strong>
</p>
<p>Regarding the timing for tapering, he only mentioned that <strong>"if the economy evolves broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year."</strong>
 Earlier in the month, several FOMC speakers had said that the Fed needs to start tapering sooner rather than later. Thus Powell failing to communicate the starting month was a negative surprise.</p>
<h2>Big banks expect tapering in November</h2>
<span class="post-quote">We do not expect a tapering announcement in September but do expect it November, with the likelihood that the actual reduction in the pace of purchases begins in December, </span>
<span class="quote-author">said John Velis, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, in a note to clients.</span>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/eur_usd_14c598efbb.jpg" alt="EURUSD exchange rate">
<p>Analysts at the investment banking giant Goldman Sachs expect a similar path. <strong>They anticipate a November announcement, December start, and September 2022 as the conclusion to the tapering process.</strong>
</p>
<p>Additionally, they think the USD will stabilize over the following weeks and possibly decline against certain currencies with attractive domestic fundamentals.</p>
<p>Later in the day, investors will pay attention to pending home sales and the Dallas Fed Manufacturing business index for Auguste. However, these data rarely cause any market movements.</p>
<p><strong>The most critical data of this week is Friday's US labor market update</strong>
. Should we see a strong payrolls print, the greenback might shake off some of its recent weakness as the Fed still appears dependent on the labor market when judging its monetary policy.</p>
<h2>Bulls in charge</h2>
<p>As we previously mentioned, the massive falling wedge pattern has been formed, and now it has been confirmed by the breakout above 1.1750. Therefore, the medium-term outlook now seems cautiously bullish.</p>
<p>The euro is currently testing the first stronger resistance of previous highs at 1.18. Should bulls be successful and push the pair above 1.18, the single currency is expected to rise toward August highs near 1.19. In addition, <strong>the bullish divergence between the MACD indicator and the price on the daily chart could also send the euro higher.</strong>
</p>
<p>The medium-term target lies at the psychological level of 1.20, where the 200-day moving average is also located, reinforcing this selling level.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if sentiment worsens and the EUR/USD pair starts declining again, it needs to defend the support at around 1/1750, where the wedge pattern's broken, bearish trend line stands. A breakdown below that level might be bad for bulls, and the bullish momentum would most likely be over.</p>

<Title>EUR/JPY attacks 130 after EU inflation data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The EUR/JPY cross was trading 0.3% stronger during the European session on Tuesday, rising toward the crucial psychological level of 130.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, <strong>German labor market data came out above market expectations, with the unemployment rate sliding to 5.5% in August</strong>
, from 5.6% previously, while the unemployment change rose from -90,000 to -53,000. The euro remained elevated after the data.</p>
<h2>European inflation continues to accelerate</h2>
<p>Additionally, the EU CPI numbers were also released. <strong>The annualized change jumped to 3.0% from 2.2% in July, versus 2.7% expectations.</strong>
 That is way above the 2% threshold set by the ECB. Furthermore, excluding food, energy, and other volatile items, <strong>the core inflation more than doubled to 1.6% from 0.7% previously</strong>
.</p>
<p>Looking at the main components of the euro area inflation, energy is expected to have the highest annual rate in August (15.4%, compared with 14.3% in July), followed by non-energy industrial goods (2.7%, compared with 0.7% in July), food, alcohol and tobacco (2.0%, compared with 1.6% in July) and services (1.1%, compared with 0.9% in July).</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/eurjpy_c046c9e366.jpg" alt="EUR/JPY news">
<p>However, the European Central Bank is not expected to taper its bond purchases or tighten monetary policy anytime soon, possibly increasing inflation further.</p>
<p>The JPY is an anti-cyclical “safe-haven” currency like the USD is. Hence, slower global growth and weaker risk appetite should drive the JPY stronger. <strong>On the other hand, sentiment in the markets remains positive and bullish, documented by the rising equities</strong>
. As long as that is the case, the Yen should be offered and remain under pressure.</p>
<span class="img-caption">External factors drive our view on USD/JPY, but we note that several domestic factors are suggesting that there is no need to be too bearish on the JPY. For example, the Bank of Japan’s balance sheet is already in the midst of tapering, and Japanese residents’ portfolio outflows have slowed.</span>
<span class="post-quote">Analysts at HSBC said a note on Tuesday.</span>
<h2>Falling wedge pattern confirmed</h2>
<p><strong>The large falling wedge pattern on the daily chart has been confirmed by the break above 129.30</strong>
, where the 200-day moving average was. So as long as the cross trades above 129.30, the medium-term outlook seems bullish.</p>
<p>The single currency needs to settle above the psychological round number of 130 to confirm the short-term bullish bias. Therefore, the next target should be in the 130.70 region, where previous highs are seen. <strong>There is a nice bullish divergence between the MACD indicator and the price, supporting the bullish outlook.</strong>
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the current support is at the mentioned 200-day moving average at 129.30, and if not held, the euro might decline toward the broken, bearish trend line near 129.00. However, the cross must defend this area to remain in a medium-term uptrend and for the pattern to stay active.</p>

<Title>Investro Tea: Week #35</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>News from the US</h2>
<p>The US is without any doubt still the most important force in the markets and global economy and this will not be changed even after U.S. forces leave Afganistan.</p>
<p>Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, has already stated that Fed will be creating a new policies this year that should stimulate the economy (but the direction of the stimulus is not clear yet). This might still have a huge impact on the inflation and its future levels. More about this <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/powell-says-fed-could-start-scaling-back-stimulus-this-year-11630072789">in the following article from WSJ</a>

<p>American households have seen in July an increase in its average income levels by around 1,1 %, which is positive news. According to the analysts, this increase is higher than expected and shows that in near term the markets might be showing even more strength. Moreover, this increase in the levels was the highest since March. It is important to note though that the households received a tax relief in the amount of almost 1 600 USD per child (as a part of pandemic relief programme). Therefore, this increase in the "wealth" of households is probably not connected to actual increase in wages or income of the households, but rather to the decrease of tax duties.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note though that the consumer spending has slowed down by 0,3 %. This is not the biggest number, however, it shows that the consumers are saving more than before.

<Title>USD/JPY statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.44%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.44%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.22%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.22%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was <strong>0.07%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>1</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the middle phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210831_Cycles_22c4cfa9c1.jpg" alt="USD/JPY daily price indexation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the **6 months **and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. As we can see in the chart below, all <strong>USD/JPY</strong>
 MAs are still in bullish sentiment. In the event of a decline, the monthly MA can be an important support for the exchange rate.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210831_Mo_M_a7ab279e49.jpg" alt="USD/JPY daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, we have witnessed higher upward trend, even though the price is lower. It did not exceed <strong>4</strong>
 days. The total maximum in the measured period (last 3 years) is <strong>6</strong>
 days. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. The total maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>7</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.54%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.35%</strong>
, which is below average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.00%</strong>
 and <strong>1.00%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to side trading. The exchange rate is currently very close to the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>78.60</strong>
, the psychological level of <strong>110.00</strong>
 and the short-term moving average, which could act as resistance in the event of further growth. The divergence between pair development and the RSI, which was created in July/August, also supports this scenario. The demand zone (green rectangle) looks like an important area.</p>

<Excerpt>Consumer sentiment is declining according to the best-know indicators in the USA. Greater uncertainty in the global market could cause more volatility for the pair. The current price of the USD/JPY exchange rate is 110.04 (August 31, 2021). Let us therefore now turn to statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>Nasdaq rises to new highs after ADP miss</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index soared to new all-time highs and was trading half a percent higher during the US session, seen at around 15,680 USD.</p>
<p><strong>The dovishness and bullish sentiment is still felt in the markets as Jerome Powell gave all the bulls the green light last Friday</strong>
, saying the Fed is in no hurry to taper and rates will remain at the current levels for an extended period of time.</p>
<h2>ADP misses, manufacturing beats</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, August's <strong>US ADP employment change report has been very weak (again) and the number came out at 374,000, a huge miss to the 638,000 new jobs expected</strong>
, and it was below the lowest forecast polled by economists (+400,000).</p>
<span class="quote-author">Our data, which represents all workers on a company's payroll, has highlighted a downshift in the labor market recovery. We have seen a decline in new hires, following significant job growth from the first half of the year, </span>
<span class="post-quote">said Nela Richardson, ADP chief economist.</span>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/nasdaq_c57d4126e0.jpg" alt="nasdaq index">
<p>Again, the bad news was good news for the stock market, especially for the tech stocks, which surged immediately as traders might start pricing in another delay in the Fed's tapering plans.</p>
<p>Additionally, the** ISM manufacturing survey for August came out better than expected and printed 59.9, up from 59.5 previously** and above analysts' expectations of 58.5. However, the inflation component – prices paid – dipped notably, from 85.7 to 79.4, while the employment index worsened to 49, from 52.9 previously.</p>
<span class="img-caption">Still, while corporate results are robust, concerns about the delta variant, inflation spikes, supply bottlenecks, and stimulus tapering could easily trigger a 10%-20% drop in stock prices,</span>
<span class="quote-author">said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote.</span>
<h2>Bulls remain in charge</h2>
<p>The technical situation still appears bullish in whatever timeframe we look. The previous consolidation period, which lasted one month, has been broken to the upside, confirming the bullish bias. <strong>The next medium-term target will most likely be at the psychological barrier at 16,000 USD.</strong>
</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the index starts dropping, the intraday support is near 15,600 USD, while the medium-term support could be at previous highs in the 15,200 USD region. Therefore, the index needs to stay above that level for the short-term outlook to look bullish.</p>
<p>However, US stocks are very overextended from their moving averages, usually leading to a correction, at least toward the 50-day average (for Nasdaq, that would be at 15,000 USD). Therefore, volatility could pick up any day, but still, the best strategy seems to be buying the dips.</p>

<Title>How does gold and silver look after the dump?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Gold</h2>
<p>If we look at the chart of the gold, we can clearly see when the dump happened. It only took gold about a month to recover to the predump levels, which means that it is attacking the resistance around 1 832 USD. Therefore, we can clearly see that the dump in the markets did not lead to any long term complications. We can therefore state that this dump was in the long run meaningless and not somehow crucial.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Gold approaching long term resistance, Source: Author´s analysis </span>
<h2>Did daily chart change?</h2>
<p>If we look at the daily chart, we also cannot see any significant change. This huge dump got only to the levels of 1 677 USD, which is a support level. A move under this area would probably cause more troubles, however, that did not happen. Daily chart thus remains the same and we only need to wait for a break from the forming descending triangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Short term chart of gold, Source: Author´s analysis</span>
<h2>Silver</h2>
<p>Silver and gold are in many cases brought together. The main movement was seen on gold, yet, since silver tends to copy movements of gold, it also saw a major crash. But, just like gold, silver was also able to hold the main support, which means, it can now rise to the levels of 24.56 USD. This is an area of strong long term resistance. Moreover a daily trendline is also in this area, which means that silver can experience real problems. Compared to gold, which is almost back at the same predump levels, silver has still a long way to go to catch up what it lost during the dump.</p>

<Title>Silver awaits Non-farm payrolls around 24 USD</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The USD continues to decline, with the EURUSD pair rising six straight days, supporting precious metals. On Friday, silver was up half a percent, trying to settle above the 24 USD level again, while gold was seen changing hands near 1,815 USD.</p>
<h2>US labor market under scrutiny</h2>
<p><strong>The headline event of today's trading will be the US labor market update for August.</strong>
 Traders expect 750,000 new jobs, according to the non-farm payrolls methodology, down from 943,000 in July. The unemployment rate should improve slightly to 5.2% from 5.4% previously, and the year-on-year wage growth is forecast to stay at 4.0%.</p>
<p>The market's initial reaction should be obvious this time – should the NFP number end below 750,000, stocks, bonds, and precious metals will most likely move sharply higher. On the other hand, if the NFP surprises to the upside, equities, and precious metals should decline, sending the USD higher.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/silver_9fb48899f4.jpg" alt="XAG/USD bars and coins">
<p>Later today, <strong>the ISM survey from the services sector is due. Market participants anticipate a decline to 61.5, from 64.1 previously</strong>
, possibly undermining the greenback as the services sector is the most important in the US economy.</p>
<p>The reasoning is simple – <strong>if the economic data start to slow down over the following weeks, the Fed might delay its tapering process, which would be a big dovish decision.</strong>
</p>
<h2>Is the technical analysis bearish?</h2>
<span class="img-caption">Silver is approaching the three-month resistance line at 24.87 USD, the recent rally is regarded as corrective only, and we are alert to failure here. This would cast attention back to the long-term pivotal support at 21.87/17 USD. These represent the September and November 2020 lows and also July 2014 high and 2016 high. These are considered to be an influential band of support, and we expect them to hold,</span>
<span class="post-quote">Karen Jones, Team Head FICC Technical Analysis Research at Commerzbank, said recently.</span>
<p><strong>She thinks that silver will fall toward 18.95 USD once it breaks below 21.17 USD.</strong>
 That would be quite a considerable drop, although the 21.17 USD support is circa 12% below the current price of 24 USD.</p>
<p><strong>The current consolidation phase looks like a rising wedge pattern, which in this case, could be a continuation formation in the current medium-term downtrend.</strong>
</p>
<p>Should silver drop below 23.50 USD, the pattern might be activated, pointing to a decline toward 23 USD or possibly lower. Alternatively, the resistance seems to be at this week's highs near 24.15 USD. If silver rises above them, the pattern might be invalidated, with the metal possibly rising to the 50-day moving average at 24.87 USD.</p>
<p>However, since volatility will be elevated today due to the NFP release and technical analysis is not as relevant as major data news, everything will be decided after the figures, and a new short-term trend might begin.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Are we ready for 50 000 USD break? </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Looking at September</h2>
<p>Looking at daily chart of Bitcoin, I feel that in the coming weeks we can expect a more significant drawdown. I personally believe that it would mostly be a sharp, fast downward correction. This would however also mean that the rebound back would be also very fast. This is due to the fact that from the viewpoints of the long term bull market predictions, which are also supported by Stock-to-Flow model, we do not have a lot of time for a long term correction. Thus, if the bull market should continue, we should be expecting more upward movements rather than downwards.</p>
<p>Yet, we have seen on many occasions that Bitcoin gives us a chance to buy after summer at lower prices through more significant and sharp dump. These are usually followed by extraordinary growth periods. This phenomenon was for example present in the year 2017, when BTC fell to 3 000 USD and we all know what happened afterwards (sharp rise to almost 20 000 dollars by December 2017).</p>
<p>The same was visible also last year, where we tested 10 000 USD in September for the last time and then we only grew up. I therefore believe that we can expect a sharp dump this month, that might be a last buying opportunity before we „go to the moon.“</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/Bitcoin_monthly_b2e6b14e26.png" alt="Bitcoin monthly chart">
<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin monthly chart, Source: Author´s analysis</span>
<h2>Break of 50 000 USD incoming?</h2>
<p>However, in the short term view (coming hours – maximum end of this week), we can be looking at the break of 50 000 USD. Most important thing for this was the yesterdays daily close, where we saw the wick touch the MA21 and MA77. This is really, really bullish. Are you asking why? Because this says that the bears had the will to push the price down, however, the MA showed strong support and in combination with significant buy orders, were able to keep the price above these levels.</p>
<p><em>Edited</em>
: Bitcoin is currently fighting to stay over 50 000 USD, which it broke only few moments ago.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin hourly chart, Source: Author´s Analysis</span>
<h2>What should you take from this?</h2>
<p>Well, even though the short term looks bullish since BTC is trying to stay above 50 000 USD again, you should still be careful and expect a fast sharp dump (not even a correction, just a movement that can occur in matter of hours) and then we would be ready for new ATH.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>As always, we will look today mostly at the price of Bitcoin from not only short term view of few hours range, but also from long term view on the monthly chart. These two views are, however, vastly different.</Excerpt>

<Title>XAG/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.30%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.37%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.67%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.62%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>3.39%</strong>
, which is slightly below the second standard deviation. Our scoring is currently slightly positive (<strong>1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>1</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. Indexing is currently on its way north. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210903_cycles_8948eda939.jpg" alt="XAG/USD daily price indexation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. <strong>XAG/USD</strong>
 has risen above the short-term moving average in recent days. In the medium and long term, however, MAs still support bearish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210903_Mo_M_7152c2d56b.jpg" alt="XAG/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, there have been more declining trends, with a maximum of <strong>4</strong>
 consecutive days. The total maximum for the downtrend for the last 3 years is <strong>8</strong>
 days. Upward trends have not exceeded more than <strong>2</strong>
 consecutive days in recent months. The total maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>5</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.65%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.91%</strong>
, which is below the average value. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.0%</strong>
 and <strong>3.0%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>4.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to a slight bullish development in recent weeks. In addition, it was very important for bulls to rebound upwards from the demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>38.20%</strong>
. However, the <strong>XAG/USD</strong>
 is currently very close to the psychological level of <strong>25.00</strong>
 and the short-term moving average. The divergence between price development and the RSI could motivate bears to take power. In the case of further growth, another resistance for the bulls could be the long-term moving average together with the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 and the psychological level of <strong>26.00</strong>
.</p>

<Excerpt>Yesterday’s Non-Farm Employment change disappointed market participants, causing major precious metals to move higher. The current price of XAG/USD - Silver Spot US Dollar is 24.69 (September 03, 2021). The price of a commodity is approaching an important level. We will therefore move on to statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>AUD/USD slides amid profit-taking</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian dollar declined slightly on Monday as traders locked in some profits after the recent rally. During the EU session, the Aussie was down 0.25% and trading near 0.7430.</p>
<p><strong>The AUD/USD pair has staged an impressive recovery following the selling in the middle of August</strong>
. Thus, it looks like the drop below the critical support of 0.7320 was a false one, and the medium-term uptrend might resume.</p>
<p>There are no essential macro data on the agenda today as US investors celebrate Labor day. Thus, volatility is expected to be minimal throughout the rest of the day.</p>
<h2>Weak NFP numbers undermined greenback</h2>
<p>Traders sold the USD on Friday as <strong>the non-farm payrolls showed the US economy created only 235,000 new jobs in August, way below the 750,000 expected</strong>
. The unemployment rate slid (improved) to 5.2% from 5.4% previously, while average hourly earnings (wage growth) rose to 4.3% from 4.1% previously.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/AUDUSD_0e0c99be0b.jpg" alt="AUD/USD exchange rate">
<p>Weaker than expected NFP numbers led to a sharp sell-off of the USD, stocks moved nowhere, and precious metals soared. The AUD/USD pair remained elevated on the day after the data.</p>
<p>Investors are now a bit confused regarding the start of tapering since <strong>Jerome Powell failed to set a date at his Jackson Hole speech and the job creation growth seems to be stalling.</strong>
 Therefore, it is likely that the market will start pricing a possible delay in tapering from November to December or January. That should be negative for the greenback over the medium-term.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>the US ISM from the services sector also weakened and printed 61.7 in August, down from 64.1 in July</strong>
, but the employment subindex remained above 50.0.</p>
<h2>Bulls remain in charge while above the 50-day average</h2>
<p>The 50-day moving average now stands at 0.7350, and as long as the Aussie trades above it, the short-term outlook seems bullish.</p>
<span class="img-caption">The short-covering squeeze in AUD/USD ties in with the rebound in China Tech stocks, but last week’s return over 0.7450 appears overdone. Short-term holding above 0.7390, the AUD/USD pair could inch higher towards 0.7500 and the 200-DMA near 0.7560/0.7600, the daily Ichimoku cloud. This could be a significant hurdle,</span>
<span class="quote-author">analysts at Commerzbank said in a note on Monday.</span>
<p>Alternatively, should the pair decline below the 50-day average, we could see a drop toward the previous lows near 0.7320. If the Aussie closes below that support on a daily basis, the medium-term bearish trend could resume.</p>
<p><strong>A correction toward the 50-day moving average could be expected</strong>
, considering the strong rally over the previous days, but bulls need to defend it for the Aussie to remain bullish.</p>

<Title>EUR/AUD shoots higher after RBA, EU data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The exotic EUR/AUD cross rose 0.6% during the EU session on Tuesday and climbed back above the critical 1.60 handle, implying the recent correction might be over. Volatility has been elevated today due to main macro events.</p>
<h2>Negative RBA fallout sends AUD lower</h2>
<p><strong>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) tapered its bond purchases from 5 billion AUD to 4 billion AUD a week</strong>
 earlier in the day. That step had been widely expected, thus no surprises there. The new pace of 4 billion AUD a week should stay unchanged at least till February 2022.</p>
<p>However, <strong>the following statement was slightly negative. The Australian central bank expects a slowdown in the third quarter GDP</strong>
, mainly due to the neverending coronavirus lockdown and restrictions.</p>
<p>Therefore, the initial reaction to the tapering news was bullish, and the Australian dollar strengthened. Still, the disappointing statement sent the AUD sharply lower, with the AUD/USD pair down more than 0.5% on Tuesday.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/EURAUD_22a7298f9f.jpg" alt="EUR/AUD forex cross">
<h2>EU data undermine Euro</h2>
<p>The focus of market participants then turned to a batch of EU data. <strong>German industrial production for July improved to 1% from -1% previously</strong>
, with the yearly basis also moving higher.
On the other hand, the German ZEW survey surprised to the downside, with the economic sentiment dropping sharply to 26.5, from 40.4 previously. The current situation improved slightly, but that is the least essential subindex as markets are forward-looking. <strong>The Eurozone ZEW Economic Sentiment for September slumped to 31.1 for the current month, compared to the 42.7 in August</strong>
 and 52.2 forecast.</p>
<span class="img-caption">Market experts expect the economic situation to improve. Yet, the scope and dynamics of the recovery have been significantly reduced. Chip shortages in the automotive sector and scarcity of resources in construction have significantly impacted expectations in those sectors,</span>
<span class="post-quote">ZEW President Achim Wambach said in the following message.</span>
<p>From other news, the EU GDP for the second quarter rose 14.3% year-on-year, better than expected. Furthermore, the quarterly change jumped 2.2%, above the 2% scored previously. Lastly, the employment change rose more than expected in the same quarter.</p>
<h2>Medium-term uptrend remains intact for now</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, <strong>the EUR/AUD cross remains in a medium-term uptrend.</strong>
 Therefore, the latest correction will most likely be bought. However, the Euro has already surged above the 50-day moving average at 1.6010. Additionally, <strong>it looks like a double bottom pattern on the daily chart, with the support at 1.59 and the full potential of the formation circa 500 pips.</strong>
</p>
<p>The next target for bulls is expected to be at 1.6115, afterward at 1.6170. The medium-term resistance is located at the current cycle highs near 1.6400, where the EUR/AUD cross topped in August.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the price declines back below the 1.60 threshold, it might revisit the 1.59 support. Falling below it would most likely cancel the medium-term uptrend with a possible drop to the uptrend line at 1.5750.</p>

<Title>NZD/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.58%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.60%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.30%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.28%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was <strong>-0.29%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that the indexation is in the extreme positive phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210907_Cycles_85600ffd6e.jpg" alt="NZD/USD daily price indexation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the **6 months **and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to all MAs, <strong>NZD/USD</strong>
 is in bullish sentiment because it is above them. In the case of a decline, quarterly and annual MAs could be the first important exchange rate supports.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210907_Mo_M_f7cd5afa61.jpg" alt="NZD/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>There have been longer downward trends since our last analysis, with a maximum of <strong>4</strong>
 consecutive days. The maximum in the measured period is <strong>8</strong>
 days. Upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. The maximum in the measured period is <strong>6</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.97%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.61%</strong>
, which is below the average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.2%</strong>
 and <strong>1.2%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>2.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to bullish sentiment since the middle of August. Dynamic drop of exchange rate was followed by the growth and therefore created bear trap. However, we can also clearly see the bearish divergence between the market price and the RSI, which moved the pair back to the long-term moving average. Further stop could be the demand zone (green rectangle), where are also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
, the short-term moving average and the important psychological level of <strong>0.7200</strong>
.</p>

<Title>Global interest in cryptocurrencies is growing</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Central bank policy and macroeconomic instability</h2>
<p>The World Economic Forum (WEF) states that there are four main factors that are causing a worldwide wave of cryptocurrency adoption. In its new report, the independent international organization argues that interest in cryptocurrencies is growing due to a combination of several economic drivers. The first they describe is the policy of central banks around the world. This, <strong>together with hyperinflation and macroeconomic instability, leads to the devaluation of traditional FIAT currencies.</strong>
 All this, of course, combined with concerns about the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>These pressures cause that an increasing number of <strong>large companies tend to keep their funds, or part of it, in cryptocurrencies.</strong>
 And we are not talking about any small companies, but about real giants - Microstrategy, Tesla, Square, and others. In general, it can be said that the institutional demand for cryptocurrencies is growing. According to the latest weekly CoinShares report about digital asset fund flows, there has been an <strong>inflow of $ 98 million in institutional capital</strong>
 for crypto investment products. Of that, up to $ 59 million went to Bitcoin (BTC) and the rest was shared mainly between Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Polkadot (DOT), and Ripple (XRP).</p>

<span class="img-caption">Rocket launch to the moon as a Bitcoin price increase concept, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<span class="quote-author">“Bitcoin saw inflows totalling US $ 59 million, marking a potential turnaround in sentiment amongst investors. This is the first inflow following an 8-week spell of outflows, the longest endured by any digital asset investment product. ”</span>
<span class="post-quote">CoinShares report</span>
<h2>Cryptocurrencies do not allow illegal financial activities</h2>
<p>More often than not, we hear the exact opposite statements, but they usually come from people who do not understand or do not want to understand cryptocurrencies. In this respect, the WEF rightly argues that cryptocurrencies offer a <strong>unique chance to create a more transparent financial system.</strong>
 Cryptocurrencies can even assist regulators that are actively seeking to move transactions from the informal to the formal economy.</p>
<span class="quote-author">“Regulators have highlighted the pseudonymous and borderless nature of cryptocurrency systems as potential money laundering and terrorist financing risks. Yet, illicit activity is significantly less than in the traditional financial system, comprising just 0.34 % of all cryptocurrency transactions. "</span>
<span class="post-quote">World Economic Forum report</span>
<h2>Stablecoins - a much more effective medium of exchange</h2>
<p>Stablecoins are another important factor identified by the WEF in their report. They compare this type of cryptocurrency with classical national currencies. In principle, they claim that anyone who understands how their system works must see the <strong>undeniable benefits of stablecoins.</strong>
 It should also be noted that some countries are already working on similar systems.</p>
<span class="quote-author">“The market cap of USD Coin (USDC), for instance, has passed $ 25 billion with a compound annual growth rate of more than 6,100 %. Such traction has even inspired Sweden to pivot its planned e-krona in order to compete with such cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). ”</span>
<span class="post-quote">World Economic Forum report</span>
<h2>Wide range of cryptocurrency applicability</h2>
<p>It is this aspect that the WEF chose as the last of the four and could theoretically be the most important. This is because various digital assets offer a <strong>huge number of ways to apply them in real life.</strong>
 An excellent example is the rocket-growing <strong>DeFi industry, which is now literally writing the future of the financial world.</strong>
 Evidence of this is the hundreds of different projects around the world that are developing solutions that will soon make our lives easier. The efforts of cryptocurrencies to improve their ecosystems were also mentioned in a positive direction.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/world_economic_forum_wef_85d989835d.jpg" alt="World Economic Forum (WEF)">
<span class="img-caption">World Economic Forum (WEF), Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<span class="quote-author">“Such improvements are also propelling DeFi (decentralized finance) application usage. The rapid proliferation and maturation of these innovations is in large part due to the open-source architecture and global developer communities that undergird crypto networks. ”</span>
<span class="post-quote">World Economic Forum report</span>
<p>The World Economic Forum is an impartial institution that (unlike others) is not interested in distorting the data and their interpretation. If you compare these statements with the statements of the representatives of countries or financial institutions, you will probably notice considerable discrepancies. Why?</p>

<Title>Investro Tea: Week #36</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Dealing with pandemic</h2>
<p>Economists from Goldman Sachs have lowered their predictions for the growth in USA from 6 % to 5.7 %. They argue that the American consumers should be expecting a delta variant of Covid-19, which can make the road to"beating the pandemic" harder. In combination with lowering fiscal stimulus, this might not have the best impact on the average Joe. The decrease in the prediction is not severe, yet it shows that dealing with the pandemic will not be as fast as was believed at the beginning. You can learn more about this topic <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-06/goldman-cuts-u-s-growth-forecast-as-consumer-sees-harder-path">here</a>
.</p>
<p>A slight drawback can be also seen within airlines and hotels. It is expected that the ongoing business trips of entrepreneurs and businessmen will restart soon, yet many companies have been forced to stop the business trips due to Covid-19. For instance, Delta Airline said that during the summer they were able to reach only 40 % of their pre-pandemic travelling capacities.</p>
<p>These findings were also supported by a research of Morning Consult, where more than 60% of respondents stated that they are currently postponing or cancelling their business trips. And there is more of these "small bumps." For instance, Ryanair the biggest non-US client of Boeing has just withdrawn from a new possible order for 737 MAX. If you are more interesting in seeing, where can the Covid-19 pandemic be still witnessed within the airlines or hospitality industries, feel free to follow <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-resurgence-clouds-business-travel-rebound-11630920600">this article</a>
.</p>
<h2>Crypto news</h2>
<p>As we mentioned in the intro, Bitcoin has officially become a legal tender in El Salvador, which is now the first country with a cryptocurrency as a legal tender. Only three months ago, the Bitcoin Law was officially passed by the government and then signed by the president Nayib Bukele. Moreover, he has recently also informed the public that El Salvador now holds about 550 BTC, which were bought in series of purchases in the past couple of days.</p>

<Content><![CDATA[<p>German equity benchmark, the DAX index, which recently received ten new companies, seems to be struggling ahead of the critical ECB meeting. At the time of writing, <strong>the index was down 1% and was seen trading near 15,670 EUR, below its 50-day moving average.</strong>
 In addition, volatility is picking up, usually leading to a decline in risk assets, such as equities.</p>
<h2>ECB decision in focus</h2>
<p>As always, several policymakers at the ECB board are hawkish, and the rest is dovish. On Wednesday, the European Central Bank policymaker <strong>Robert Holzmann said that the ECB might normalize monetary policy sooner than market participants expect</strong>
. A hawkish example.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the ECB governing council member Bostjan Vasle noted that <strong>the Euro area still needs a 'highly accommodative monetary policy. "New waves of a pandemic may slow recovery,"</strong>
 he warned—a dovish example.</p>

<p>Therefore, it isn't easy to make an official expectation of what should happen at Thursday's ECB meeting. Nevertheless, analysts expect the ECB to taper its bond purchases slightly, possibly supporting the EUR/USD pair and undermining the DAX index.</p>
<span class="quote-author">The time to call an end to the pandemic-era bond purchases is not here, but we think the ECB will decide to slow down the pace of its bond-buying at its meeting,, Financial markets could interpret such a step with a slightly hawkish tilt,</span>
<span class="post-quote">said analysts at Nordea, in a note.</span>
<p>That is because inflation in the euro bloc is way above the ECB 2% target and shows no signs of slowing, putting pressure on the central bank to tighten monetary policy. On the other hand, we all know how the ECB could not raise rates between 2017-2019 when the economic situation in the eurozone was much better.</p>
<p>Still, <strong>monetary policy will remain highly loose, and investors should buy short-term dips in stocks.</strong>
</p>
<h2>DAX falls below 50-day average, looking bearish</h2>
<p><strong>The technical analysis is starting to point to a more significant correction.</strong>
 The index is now trading below the 50-day moving average (currently near 15,700 EUR), suggesting further weakness might be ahead of us until DAX reclaims the average.</p>
<p>It is now testing previous lows at 15,640 EUR, and if this support is broken to the downside, stop-losses of long positions will be hit, most likely sending the German benchmark toward 15,430 EUR. Another bearish sign was the inability to breach the psychological 16,000 EUR resistance, which led to some profit-taking after the recent rally.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if DAX reclaims the 50-day average, we could see a rally toward 15,800 EUR. But for the time being, the essential resistance stands at 16,000 EUR, and the index needs to make a daily close above it to confirm the long-term uptrend.</p>

<Title>Technical Analysis of Google and Amazon stocks</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Google</h2>
<p>Google has been “on fire” in the last few weeks, and since the COVID drop in March 2020, its shares have gained over <strong>186%</strong>
.
When we look at the trend of recent weeks and months, Google still holds the main trend line. Around which the price movement repeats in the same cycles. A similar scenario can be seen on SP500. And it is also the main trend line from which price often bounces off, followed by a steep growth. However, as soon as the price gets too high, the growth suddenly stops and a short ABC correction, or a sideways move, takes place. And it is precisely these movements that bring the price back to the main trend line from where the whole cycle repeats again.</p>
<p>In this case, trading is very simple. Either hold the share or buy every time the price touches the trend line. As long as we keep the trend, Google's stock will grow. In the end, of course, there will be a stronger downward movement, so do not forget the stop-loss, which I would always put under the current LOW.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/Investro_Google_16c918cc73.png" alt="Google shares ">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Technical analysis of Google shares</span>
<h2>Amazon</h2>
<p>Amazon shares were one of the very first to reach a whole new high after the COVID slump. But afterward, it was not all sunshine and rainbows either. Currently, the price continues in a certain bearish channel which should indicate a decline. Be that as it may, if I look at the current economic indicators from a bigger perspective I would say that what we have here is a pre-growth consolidation.</p>
<p>The Fed is still pushing money into the economy on a large scale, and stocks and indices are rising. So Amazon should not be an exception, and if nothing fundamental changes, price should break this channel upwards. However, this may take some time. A definitive confirmation will arrive once the price hits a new maximum and gets above the trend.</p>

<Title>EUR/USD stable after ECB decision</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, the single currency remained elevated and barely moved after the latest ECB monetary policy decision, with the EUR/USD pair trading some 35 pips above the critical 1.18 threshold.
All the focus today was on the ECB meeting, which failed to bring any surprises.</p>
<h2>ECB meets expectations</h2>
<p>The European Central Bank left monetary policy unchanged, as widely expected, and the deposit rate was kept at -0.5%. The primary refinancing rate stayed at zero. However, **the Governing Council decided to "taper" its monthly emergency bond purchases, previously running at 80 billion EUR a month. **</p>
<span class="quote-author">Based on a joint assessment of financing conditions and the inflation outlook, the Governing Council judges that favorable financing conditions can be maintained with a moderately lower pace of net asset purchases under the PEPP than in the previous two quarters,</span>
<span class="post-quote">the ECB said in a statement Thursday.</span>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/eur_usd_14c598efbb.jpg" alt="EURUSD exchange rate">
<p>The emergency QE program, also known as the PEPP (Pandemic emergency purchase program), should continue until it reaches 1,850 billion EUR or until at least March 2022. Additionally, inflation is expected to exceed the 2% goal moderately only for a transitory period. The same thing as the Fed keeps saying.</p>
<p><strong>Since the ECB has already started to reduce its bond purchases and the Fed is expected to do so in December, it creates a possible bullish signal for the EUR/USD pair</strong>
 as the respective monetary policies are diverging slightly.</p>
<p>From other news, US initial jobless claims improved notably in the previous week, down to 310,000 from 345,000 previously, lowering the four-week average to 339,500 from 356,000. Continuing claims also improved, but as much as expected, and dropped to 2.78 million.</p>
<h2>Bullish breakout still valid</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, <strong>the medium-term uptrend remains intact as the EUR/USD pair managed to defend its 500-day moving average at 1.18.</strong>
 Therefore, the bullish breakout from the falling wedge pattern is still valid, supported by the bullish divergence between the price and the MACD oscillator.</p>
<p>Bulls need to push <strong>the euro above the essential resistance of 1.19 to confirm the bullish bias.</strong>
 The next target would then be at the psychological 1.20 zone, where the 200-day moving average is.</p>
<p>Alternatively, suppose sentiment worsens, and the single currency starts to decline again. In that case, the short-term support is at the mentioned 50 DMA near 1.18, and if not held, we could see a decline toward 1.1750 in the initial reaction.</p>

<Title>GBP/USD tests September highs despite huge GDP miss</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Sterling advanced on Friday, pushing the GBP/USD pair toward September highs as it was trading near 1.3880 during the London session. The anti-dollar sentiment continues to be the central theme in the markets, helping other currencies to appreciate.</p>
<h2>UK data support GBP</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, the Office for National Statistics informed that <strong>economic growth in the United Kingdom slowed to just 0.1% in July from 1% in June</strong>
 amid rising Covid cases and materials shortages. Analysts had expected 0.7%. Therefore it was a huge miss. As a result, <strong>it leaves the UK economy 2.1% below pre-pandemic levels in February 2020.</strong>
</p>
<span class="quote-author">After many months during which the economy grew strongly, making up much of the lost ground from the pandemic, there was little growth overall in July. Oil and gas provided the most significant boost, having partially bounced back after summer maintenance. Car production also continued to recover from recent component shortages,</span>
<span class="post-quote">ONS deputy national statistician Jonathan Athow said on Friday.</span>
<p>Rising costs and shortages of raw materials pegged back the construction sector again. Jonathan Athow added.</p>
<p>From other news, the British <strong>industrial production rose 1.2% month-on-month in July, up from -0.7% in June, pushing the yearly change to 3.8%</strong>
. On the other hand, manufacturing production decreased to 0.0% from 0.2% previously on a monthly basis, while the year-on-year indicator more than halved to 6% from 13.9% previously.</p>
<p>Lastly, the <strong>trade deficit widened to 12.70 billion GBP, from 11.98 billion GBP previously.</strong>
 As previously said, despite most of the data missing estimates or weakening, the Pound remained elevated on the day, capitalizing on the USD weakness.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/gbp_usd_779066137e.jpg" alt="GBP/USD exchange rate">
<p>On Wednesday, the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said that half of the MPC members already believe the minimum conditions for a rate hike have been achieved. Sterling jumped above the 50-day moving average after his remarks.</p>
<h2>Bulls in charge</h2>
<p>Judging from the recent bullish momentum, it looks like new swing highs are only a matter of time. <strong>The initial resistance is located at September highs near 1.39, and if the GBP/USD pair jumps above them, the medium-term uptrend could be confirmed, targeting the 1.40 level in the next leg up.</strong>
</p>
<p>Another bullish signal could be the breakout above the medium-term bearish trend line, which had capped the GBP/USD pair since June. Lastly, it looks like the Fed might be the most dovish out of the major central banks, possibly undermining the greenback over the following weeks.</p>
<p>The first meaningful support now stands at the 50-day moving average (circa 1.38), and as long as sterling trades above it, the short-term outlook seems bullish.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Technical Analysis </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>With slumps such as the most recent one, it is always extremely difficult to pinpoint the exact time of occurrence. Let alone on Bitcoin, for which it is typical that price falls suddenly within just a few hours. However, once it happens, it goes “all-in” and the trader has almost no time to react. It is therefore very difficult to try to get out of the market just before all this happens.</p>
<h2>The bull market on daily and weekly charts</h2>
<p>Right from the beginning, I have to mention that I think that the bull market will continue and that this slump is just a classic September correction. I think we will see a new ATH later this year and that we can easily exceed the $ 100,000 mark this year. I dare to say that this whole decline on BTC is a mere correction that could end in a while. But let’s take a look at daily and weekly charts.</p>
<p>On the weekly chart, we tested the EMA21 level, which is key for the continuation of the bull market. This was also the case in 2016 and 2017 when we were testing it almost on a regular basis. A similar situation happened last year. At that time, Bitcoin has tested EMA21 at $ 10,000 for the last time in September, and then rose steadily to its ATH, $ 64,000. So this situation seems to be repeating itself and I consider maintaining this level as essential for the next bull market. Of course, the wick can easily go lower on the weekly chart, but the body of the candle should adhere to the EMA21 level which is currently at $ 43,213. This is the level I will be monitoring at the end of the week.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Bitcoin on September 2020</span>
<h2>So everything is clear on the weekly chart. But what about the daily one?</h2>
<p>On the daily chart, I see the level of $ 43,487 - 40,604 as basic support. In terms of daily charts, it would be ideal if we could stay above $ 40,000. If we accidentally got below this level, the fall would be stronger and would destroy the current structure. We would not want that to happen. So this level is absolutely crucial for us.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 3: Bitcoin on September 2021</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now, we have to wait for Bitcoin to move. This cryptocurrency did not have a typical correction rather than a clean dump that lasted a few hours. So let’s give the charts some time to get back on their feet.</p>

<Excerpt>This week, we have finally witnessed the slump on the market. Which is something which I have been expecting to happen for quite a while.</Excerpt>

<Title>Lords of the markets: Alexander Elder</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>In the following stories of these personalities, you will find something valuable that you will take away from the point of view of understanding the world of finance. First will be about Dr. Alexander Elder.</p>
<p>Dr. Alexander Elder was born in the former Soviet Union, more specifically in Leningrad. Subsequently, he grew up in where he also began studying medicine as a teenager. He then worked as a ship's doctor. After anchoring his ship in Africa, he took the opportunity to flee the ship to later gain political asylum in the United States, where he also currently lives. He worked here for several years as a psychiatrist. He used his knowledge of human psychology and the heart of reasoning when he entered the world of business. Today, he lectures at various conferences and is a member of several trade associations and above all he is a highly respected professional trader and author of bestsellers in this field.</p>
<p>He is rightfully considered one of the best traders in the world, his books are considered the best of their kind, namely <em>Come into My Trading Room: A Complete Guide to Trading</em>
, which was evaluated as Barron's Book of the Year. <em>Entries & Exits: Visits to 16 Trading Rooms</em>
, <em>The New Sell & Sell Short: How to Take Profits, Cut Losses</em>
, and <em>Benefit from Price Declines</em>
. However, the absolute bestseller is <em>The New Trading for a Living</em>
. This book can certainly be included in the basic literature of millions of traders around the world. It is from this book that we would like to publish its first passage:</p>
<span class="quote-author">"You can be free. You can live and work anywhere in the world. You can be independent from routine and not answer to anybody. This is the life of a successful trader. Many aspire to it but few succeed. An amateur looks at a quote screen and sees millions of dollars sparkle in front of his face. He reaches for the money—and loses. He reaches again—and loses more. Traders lose because the game is hard, or out of ignorance, or from lack of discipline. If any of these ail you, I wrote this book for you."</span>
<span class="post-quote">Elder, Alexander. Trading for a Living: Psychology, Trading Tactics, Money Management.</span>

<Excerpt>The world of business and finance has seen a considerable number of successful and inspiring personalities. It must be said that many of them have incredible stories behind. We would like to gradually introduce you to at least some of them who, in our opinion, belong to the imaginary Olympus of Finance and who deserve your attention.</Excerpt>

<Title>EUR/JPY defends 50-day average ahead of Lagarde speech</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The EUR/JPY cross was trying to get back above the psychological level of 130 during the EU session on Monday. Still, considering the lack of macro data, volatility might be minimal today.</p>
<p>Traders paid attention to German wholesale price indices for the month of August.  <strong>Inflation rose to 12.3% yearly in Aug versus +11.3% in July. This was the highest monthly annual rate of inflation since October 1974 after the first oil crisis.</strong>
</p>
<h2>EU officials spoke Monday</h2>
<p>From other news, the <strong>German economy ministry said Monday that the GDP growth is likely to pick up significantly in Q3 following a 1.6% QoQ rise</strong>
 in the previous quarter. He also said that the GDP growth is expected to normalize in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, central bankers keep saying that inflation is only transitory and will decrease over the following quarters.</p>
<p>The <strong>European Central Bank Executive Board member Isabel Schnabel said that inflation would noticeably decrease as soon as next year.</strong>
 However, a premature monetary policy tightening in response to a temporary rise in inflation would choke the recovery.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/eurjpy_c046c9e366.jpg" alt="EUR/JPY news">
<p>So basically, all inflation measures are up sharply, people are paying way more for everything, and central banks are reluctant to tighten monetary policy. It smells of stagflation or hyperinflation.</p>
<p>Later in the day, the ECB president Christine Lagarde speaks, and her comments might move the EUR/JPY cross, especially if she talks about monetary policy and future plans.</p>
<h2>Chart not so bullish anymore</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, should the EUR/JPY continue to decline, <strong>the medium-term trend might change back to bearish if the euro closes below the 50-day moving average.</strong>
 The next support could be located at 129.00.</p>
<p>However, if the single currency bounces off the 50DMA, the next target is at the psychological level of 130.00, followed by Friday's highs at 130.20. It seems that the essential resistance is at 130.65, where the cross has failed many times in September.</p>
<p><strong>The recent breakout from the falling wedge pattern is losing its steam, and bulls need to build up some momentum soon.</strong>
 Otherwise, risks are for a larger correction below 129.</p>

<Title>XCU/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.25%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.20%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.63%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.58%</strong>
. Today´s return is <strong>-1.98%</strong>
, whish is slightly above the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-1</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in a slightly positive phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. <strong>XCU/USD</strong>
 has risen above short-term and medium-term MAs in recent days. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, all MAs support bullish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210913_Mo_M_3fb5770d8c.jpg" alt="XCU/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, we have witnessed more downward trends that did not exceed <strong>3</strong>
 consecutive days. The total maximum in the measured period (last 3 years) is <strong>12</strong>
 days. Also, upward trends in recent months have not exceeded more than <strong>3</strong>
 days. The total maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>11</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.75%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>3.67%</strong>
, which is more than twice the average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-2.5%</strong>
 and <strong>2.5%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>3.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis currently supports short-term bullish sentiment, as the price of the commodity rises after it has dynamically rebounded from the demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the psychological level of <strong>4.0000</strong>
. The <strong>XCU/USD</strong>
 is currently very close to the short-term moving average, which currently acts as a support. The divergence between price development and the RSI also supports this scenario.</p>

<Excerpt>The change in inventories in the London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses is positive again after 3 weeks. If it further rises, the market price could continue its short-term decline. The current price of XCU/USD - Copper Spot US Dollar is 4.343 (September 13, 2021). Therefore, we will now look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>El Salvador has adopted Bitcoin as the country's official currency</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>For the first time, we see the acceptance of cryptocurrency by the entire country</h2>
<p>El Salvador became the <strong>first country to officially adopt Bitcoin as legal tender,</strong>
 on an equal level with the dollar, which has dominated the country's economy for the past two decades. President Nayib Bukele believes that Bitcoin has the potential to solve one of the most difficult economic problems in El Salvador. The volume of money that citizens send from abroad represents up to a fifth of the country's GDP. The problem is high transaction fees, and in addition, up to 70% of the population does not have access to a bank account. Bitcoin should solve these problems without the need for banks.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/el_salvador_flag_draped_over_a_bitcoin_cryptocurrency_coin_c4e7696dce.jpg" alt="El Salvador flag draped over a Bitcoin cryptocurrency coin">
<span class="img-caption">El Salvador flag draped over a Bitcoin cryptocurrency coin, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>Each citizen received $ 30 in Bitcoin, which they can use as they want to. <strong>Companies are required by law to accept Bitcoin payments</strong>
 and may convert them into dollars immediately upon receipt of payment. In recent days, we have been following various reports on the operation of the new system and it seems that, except for minor bugs, it works without any problems. People are sharing a post about how they pay in Bitcoin, for example, at McDonald's.</p>
<h2>Let's look at the negatives associated with this type of adoption of Bitcoin</h2>
<p>It is certainly important to say that <strong>not all the people of El Salvador are enthusiastic about these steps.</strong>
 The wave of criticism comes mainly from the ranks of business entities, as not everyone wants to accept cryptocurrencies. However, this problem is relatively easy to solve, since companies that do not want to keep cryptocurrencies can convert all of them to dollars. Some residents are equally dissatisfied and their main criticism is the complexity of the system (especially among the elderly) as well as fears of high volatility.</p>
<p>A part of the cryptocurrency community also had a negative opinion on the topic, claiming that <strong>the message of cryptocurrencies is mainly freedom and that enforcing payments in cryptocurrencies is as bad as banning them.</strong>
 However, the possibility of an immediate conversion back to USD and the "forced" adoption of Bitcoin only on the part of companies offer the ordinary citizen quite enough level of freedom. It can be assumed that many of them will eventually understand the benefits Bitcoin offers them and learn to use the new system.</p>
<p>In particular, state officials are talking about <strong>huge savings on the fees that residents pay to send money to their territory</strong>
 (for example, through services such as Western Union). It could be up to 400 million dollars a year, and the speed of transactions is certainly a significant benefit. By comparison, when sending an amount via Bitcoin Lightning Network, the fees are close to zero and the transaction is processed almost immediately.</p>
<h2>The government is also trying to attract foreign investors and capital</h2>
<p>The latest news is that, according to the president's legal adviser, the government will reportedly <strong>exempt investors from paying capital gains taxes and Bitcoin income taxes.</strong>
 Javier Argueta also said that they are trying to attract foreign investors through these tax breaks.</p>
<span class="quote-author">“If a person has assets in Bitcoin and makes high profits, there will be no tax. This is done obviously to encourage foreign investment ... either the capital increase or the income. ”</span>
<span class="post-quote">Javier Argueta, Legal Adviser to President</span>
<p>According to the released information, the <strong>El Salvador government will actively monitor BTC transactions</strong>
 on their Chivo e-wallet and focus on <strong>fighting the potentially illegal use of cryptocurrencies.</strong>
 To this end, they allegedly implemented a series of anti-money laundering measures into the system, which were recommended to them by various international institutions. It is money laundering, drug trafficking and terrorist financing that are the biggest risks from an international perspective. However, El Salvador has already stated that the country is watching the situation, there is nothing to worry about.</p>
<h2>Best verification of correctness of this step will be time</h2>
<p>It must be said that El Salvador, by accepting Bitcoin as legal tender, went to <strong>unexplored waters.</strong>
 Such fundamental changes are always best reviewed by time and by the users themselves. The government could certainly have set up some parts of the process better, but at the end of the day - El Salvador is doing something groundbreaking, and of course, it cannot be done without various mistakes and criticism.</p>
<p>The people of El Salvador will no doubt be able to save a lot of money, and some of them who do not have access to a bank account will finally be able to manage their own funds. There is also speculation that the country's <strong>actions could soon be followed by others,</strong>
 and there is talk of Latin America and the Caribbean in particular.</p>

<Title>Gold shoots above 1,800 USD after US inflation data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Precious metals surged notably on Tuesday, buoyed by the weaker-than-expected US inflation. At the time of writing, gold was 0.6% stronger, rising above 1,800 USD, while silver was seen marching toward the 24 USD level again.</p>
<h2>Inflation remains elevated</h2>
<p>Today, traders focused on the key US inflation report, which came out weaker than expected and undermined the greenback, sending precious metals higher. The yearly inflation printed 5.3%, while the month-on-month change decelerated slightly to 0.3%, from 0.5% previously. <strong>That is the 15th straight monthly rise in consumer prices and the fourth consecutive month above 5% yearly.</strong>

Core CPI slowed to 4.0% year-over-year, down from 4.3% in July. Analysts had expected 4.2%.</p>
<span class="quote-author">While the sharpest price hikes associated with reopening and supply shortages are likely behind us, we do not expect inflation to snap back to its anemic pre-COVID pace quickly. We expect the CPI to remain around 5% through the first quarter of next year,</span>
<span class="post-quote">Analysts at Wells Fargo said in a note after the report.</span>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/Gold_1df0200c2a.jpg" alt="XAU/USD example of bars">
<p>As previously said, the USD got dumped after the report, as the declining core inflation might lead to a more dovish Fed, possibly delaying its tapering decision. As of now, the market expects the taper to start in November or December.</p>
<h2>Fed in focus next week</h2>
<p><strong>Next Wednesday, the Fed’s meeting will take center attention as the Fed should communicate if it wants to start scaling back asset purchases in November</strong>
. If it does not communicate anything related to tapering, gold might soar above 1,900 USD. However, judging from the recent weakness in economic data, the Fed could wait for more progress in the labor market (or economic data in general) before starting to scale back asset purchases.</p>
<p>For now, it looks like some parts of inflation might be transitory,  but most of the prices will likely remain higher for a long time. <strong>As a result, the longer inflation remains elevated, the more likely it is to become permanent.</strong>
</p>
<h2>Gold jumps above 50-day moving average</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, it is still a mess. <strong>The medium-term trend is still unclear, but gold could start some short-term bullish momentum if it closes above its 50-day moving average at 1,800 USD.</strong>
 The next target will most likely lay at 1,820 USD, followed by a firm selling zone near 1,835 USD.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if sentiment deteriorates and gold starts to decline again, the support is seen at last week’s and today’s lows in the 1,785 USD area.</p>
<p>As long as the greenback continues to be sold, amid the tapering uncertainty, gold should benefit from it. Lastly, the 10-year US yield failed to start any bullish movement, and it was down sharply today, trading below 1.3% again. Falling US yields tend to be bullish for precious metals, currently supporting the short-term uptrend.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.75%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<p>Basic technical analysis still supports medium-term bearish sentiment as the exchange rate creates lower lows and lower highs. This pair again fell below the important psychological level of <strong>0.7400</strong>
, where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
. <strong>AUD/USD</strong>
 is also very close to the short-term moving average. We can also clearly see the bearish divergence between the market price and the RSI. In the event of a further decline, the demand zone (green rectangle) with the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>38.20%</strong>
 and the psychological level of <strong>0.7000</strong>
 could again be as important for bulls as in August.</p>

<Excerpt>Today’s words from the RBA governor didn’t support the currency. Lowe doesn’t see a rate hike before 2024. The current price of the AUD/USD exchange rate is 0.7318 (September 14, 2021). In August, it rebounded from an important zone. We will therefore move on to statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>EUR/GBP unimpressed by UK inflation data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The EUR/GBP cross failed to move in a volatile day on Wednesday, and it remained anchored to its 50-day moving average, changing hands at around 0.8545.</p>
<h2>UK inflation roars higher</h2>
<p>Traders paid attention to the UK inflation data, which came out higher than expected. The Office for National Statistics informed <strong>the year-on-year CPI inflation printed 3.2% in August, up from 2.0% in July and above analysts’ forecast of 2.9%. The monthly change surged to 0.7%.</strong>
</p>
<p>The massive jump in inflation will force the governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, to write to the chancellor to explain why inflation has moved so much above the 2% target. Also, the Bank of England will need to hint at future steps to tame the soaring inflation.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <strong>core CPI indicator, which excludes food, alcohol, and energy prices, rose to 3.1% yearly, from 1.9% scored in July.</strong>
 The month-on-month change jumped to 0.7%. Since traders might start pricing in monetary policy tightening due to soaring inflation, inflation data supported the Pound, pushing EUR/GBP to daily lows near 0.8535.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/EURGBP_92f006a14e.jpg" alt="EUR/GBP Forex pair chart">
<p>From other news, the <strong>UK government introduced a new guide to learn to live with the virus</strong>
. Plan A will use existing measures such as vaccines, self-isolation, and general guidance. Still, Boris Johnson said they were prepared to use actions in Plan B, including the introduction of vaccine passports, a return to legally required face masks in some settings, and potentially a return to work from home advice.</p>
<p>In Europe, the Eurostat showed that <strong>industrial production increased more than anticipated and printed 1.5% in July. The annual basis declined slightly, from 10.1% to 7.7%, but remains strong.</strong>
 The EUR/USD pair pushed higher after the data, helping the EUR/GBP cross to come off its daily lows.</p>
<p>Later in the day, <strong>Philip R. Lane, member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, speaks.</strong>
 His remarks often indicate the possible future direction of monetary policy, possibly influencing the euro today.</p>
<h2>Daily chart remains choppy</h2>
<p>The daily chart of EURGBP continues to show no desire for a meaningful trend as the price has been moving sideways since April. <strong>The price is trying to stay above the 50-day moving average, currently near 0.8540, with the next resistance spotted at the medium-term downtrend line at 0.8880.</strong>
</p>
<p>Should the euro jump above the trend line, the following selling zone is spotted in the 0.89 – 0.8910 area, which has sent the cross lower several times already. Once the EUR/GBP cross closes above 0.8910 on a daily basis, the medium-term outlook could change to positive.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the support is seen at this week’s lows near 0.8510, and if not held, the price might drop toward the previous key demand zone at around 0.8470.</p>

<Title>AUD/USD slides after miserable employment data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The greenback renewed its strength Thursday, sending the EUR/USD pair below 1.18, which undermined the Australian dollar as well, sending it toward the essential support.</p>
<h2>Busy Australian sessions</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, <strong>the Australian labor market showed a notable weakness amid the ongoing lockdown in the country. The employment change cratered to -146,300 in August, down from 2,200 in July,</strong>
 showing some massive lay-offs in the economy as businesses are ordered to remain closed. On the other hand, the unemployment rate improved slightly to 4.5% from 4.6% previously.</p>
<p>Additionally, the RBA economic bulletin was released today, showing insights into the Australian economy. It noted that economic conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) improved in the second half of 2020 and early 2021, although measures to contain the recent outbreaks of COVID-19 have affected firms in much of Australia.</p>
<p>Since the lockdown in Australia is neverending, we might expect another lousy time for small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/AUDUSD_85ac5ad2e1.jpg" alt="AUD/USD exchange rate">
<p>Earlier in the week, the RBA governor Lowe undermined the Australian dollar, saying he does not understand why the market is pricing any rate hikes soon. He reiterated that the central bank plans to keep rates unchanged till late 2023. That was a relatively dovish comment and a piece of negative news for the Aussie.</p>
<span class="img-caption">With mining dividend conversion behind us and the US dollar likely to remain resilient through the FOMC meeting, risks remain for a test of AUD/USD 0.7200/50. Nonetheless, that’s a buying opportunity on a multi-month view, </span>
<span class="quote-author">said economists at Westpac on Thursday.</span>
<p>Later in the day, the US retail sales figures are due and expected to remain negative, although they should show a slight improvement month-on-month. Additionally, US jobless claims will be released.</p>
<h2>Short-term outlook negative</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, the AUD/USD pair has dropped below its 50-day moving average, changing the short-term bias to bearish. <strong>The pair is now licking the critical support line of previous lows at 0.7315, and if it closes below it on a daily basis, the medium-term outlook could change to bearish.</strong>
</p>
<p>In that case, the next target would be at 0.7250, and the retest of the current cycle lows at 0.71 cant be ruled out. <strong>It looks like the Fed might be faster to tighten monetary policy, potentially supporting the USD against the AUD.</strong>
</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the pair starts rallying again, the first selling zone is spotted at the 50-day average at 0.7350. A breakout above that level could lead to another leg higher, target 0.74, or the actual swing highs near 0.7450.</p>

<Title>Is DOW JONES losing its strength? What can this mean for indices in general?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>The current market situation</h2>
<p>The current situation in the markets is still very good. At the beginning of September, the Fed (American Central Bank) had an online conference that had a bullish impact on all markets. Likewise, the results of inflation from the USA are still positive and did not grow any further. Despite the announced reduction of incentives, no shock has arrived on the market yet. In my opinion, however, it is only a matter of time before its arrival. As the first index of this trio, the Dow Jones index is starting to lag behind. Let’s take a closer look at the chart.</p>
<h2>What is happening on the Dow Jones?</h2>
<p>We can clearly see the rising wedge on the chart. Similar price formation can be seen also on SP 500 and NASDAQ charts. Everything would be fine if it was not for the Dow Jones dropping out of that wedge. The lower trend is clearly breached and we have been under it for several days. We even got under EMA21, which is very respected in the world of indices. What is important now is how we will close this week.</p>
<p>It is the first sign of weakness after a long time of movement in the rising wedge. So far, however, it can be seen exclusively on this index and nowhere else. Yet no major dump or panic has arrived. Be that as it may, the market is already starting to give us signs that something is clearly wrong. If something similar were to happen on SP 500 or NASDAQ it could mean the beginning of something bigger.</p>
<p>So far, however, it is only a small ripple on the otherwise calm surface that needs to be watched never the less. What is crucial now is whether the Dow Jones can get above the EMA21 or above the trend line again in the days to come. The value of 33,705 points will be also important. We should maintain this level so that the chart does not create a lower LOW. Violation of this level would already mark the beginning of the correction.</p>

<Excerpt>The Dow Jones is one of the key indices of the world economy. Together with the SP 500 or NASDAQ, it is one of the most important indices also in the trading world. However, the last week does not look very good for this index. Because compared to the rest of the market, DOW JONES is starting to lose ground.</Excerpt>

<Title>Footsie remains below 50-day moving average after UK retail sales</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The British FTSE 100 index, also known as the Footsie, failed to jump above its 50-day moving average, confirming a neutral short-term outlook as sentiment worsened again on Friday.</p>
<h2>UK retail sales disappoint</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, the Office for National Statistics released <strong>retail sales figures for August, and they came out way below expectations. The yearly change crashed to 0.0% from 2.4% in July (versus 2.7% expected), while the ex-fuel gauge dropped even more to -0.9% from 1.8% previously</strong>
. Analysts had expected an improvement to 2.5%. Monthly figures improved somewhat but failed to reach estimates and remained in negative territory.</p>
<p>That was the <strong>fourth consecutive monthly drop in UK retail sales - their worst stretch since 1996</strong>
 – leading some economists to question how soon the Bank of England might be ready to raise interest rates in such an environment.</p>
<span class="post-quote">While European markets managed to post modest gains yesterday, it is becoming increasingly apparent that there is little in the way of direction for equity markets at the moment.
Investors are increasingly looking for a narrative, whether it be positive or negative, to drive the next move, and are coming up empty-handed,
</span>
<span class="quote-author">Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK said on Friday.</span>
<p>From the positive side, central banks are still pumping money into the financial markets at a record pace, while COVID infections are starting to decrease globally. But, on the other hand, rising prices, "transitory" inflation becoming permanent, a slowdown in the global economy, and possible tapering could be concerning and potentially bearish for stocks.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/fste_100_index_39f84869de.jpg" alt="ftse 100 equity index">
<p>Later in the day, investors will pay attention to the US Michigan consumer sentiment index for September, expected to improve slightly to 72.2 from 70.3 in July, possibly causing some market volatility.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>today marks the expiry of quarterly financial derivatives contracts on US indices and individual stocks, an event known as 'quadruple witching,' usually increasing volatility</strong>
 during the US session.</p>
<h2>Technical analysis points to further consolidation</h2>
<p>The FTSE 100 index has not moved anywhere since April/May as it has been consolidating in the 7,000 GBP area. Until we see a clear break from this consolidation zone, the medium and short-term outlooks remain neutral.</p>
<p><strong>The primary support seems to be in the 6,960 – 7,000 GBP area</strong>
, and if the price drops below it, the short-term trend might change to bearish, targeting July's lows at 6,800 GBP. Likewise, should the index drop below 6,800 GBP, the medium-term outlook will likely change to bearish, with the next area of interest for bears at 6,600 GBP.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if bulls regain control of the market, <strong>the selling zone is probably at the mentioned 50-day average at 7,090 GBP, with the following critical resistance in the 7,200 GBP.</strong>
 Breaking above it would confirm the medium and long-term uptrend.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin a week after the significant drop</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Before I embark on the analysis of Bitcoin, I would like to take a look at fundaments. This week there were 3 impactful events that would have been otherwise perceived as negative yet the market did not react to them at all. Every trading manual says that if the market ignores negative fundamentals, then it is time for growth. It makes sense because even negative fundamentals such as these could not “scare” people enough to go and sell their bitcoins and subsequently deepen the correction.</p>
<h3>These 3 mentioned fundaments are:</h3>
<li>FAKE news regarding Litecoin</li>
<li>17 hours long outage of Solana</li>
<li>Failed hack on Ethereum</li>
<p>The fact that the market did not react to these events at all signifies a bullish market.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin is far from key values</h2>
<p>If there will be any crucial price movement in the nearest future, it will take place on the daily and weekly charts. It is important now that the price will stick to $ 40,000 on the daily chart. And a day candle should not close below this value either.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_1_17_9_28f5231205.png" alt="bitcoin on a daily chart">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Bitcoin on a daily chart</span>
<p>On the weekly chart, it is important that the price will not go below EMA21, which is currently at $ 43,601.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_2_17_9_174a4608bb.png" alt="Bitcoin on a weekly chart">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Bitcoin on a weekly chart</span>
<h2>And what about the 4H chart?</h2>
<p>As for the 4H chart, at the moment there is nothing important for us that could fundamentally change the current state of Bitcoin. However, I currently see strong support at $ 46,834 - $ 47,185. It would be ideal to maintain this support. However, even if this does not happen, it is not absolutely crucial for further development. The nearest strong resistance is at $ 49,137, where rejection has occurred several times in a row.</p>
<p>As I see it, the smartest move right now would be to wait and see which key level at 4H will Bitcoin overcome first. Of course, the rule is that the longer the price holds support and goes to the side, the higher the chance that it will break the resistance. After all, our priority is still the bull market and therefore growth.</p>

<Title>XAU/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.76</strong>
% and <strong>-0.77%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.40%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.36%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>0.04%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. It was a less volatile day than the previous one. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
, which means that we estimate the middle of the declining phase of the cycle. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. <strong>XAU/USD</strong>
 fell below the short-term MA again last week. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, all MAs currently support bearish sentiment.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, we have witnessed more upward trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>3</strong>
 consecutive days. However, the maximum increase was <strong>8</strong>
 days in the measured period. The downward trend in recent weeks have not exceeded more than <strong>2</strong>
 days. The maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>6</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.40%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.03%</strong>
, which is above its long-term average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.6%</strong>
 and <strong>1.6%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>2.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<p>Basic technical analysis supports short-term bearish sentiment after Thursday’s dynamic decline. <strong>XAU/USD</strong>
 is currently very close to the support level of <strong>1 760</strong>
, where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50.00%</strong>
. The price is also below short-term and long-term moving averages. If it continues to decline, the demand zone (green rectangle), where are also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>61.80%</strong>
 and the psychological level of <strong>1 700</strong>
, could also provide some support for the bulls, as in March and early August.</p>

<Title>Lords of the markets: Warren Buffett</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Warren Buffet is one of the best known and most influential investors today. He first founded the Buffet Partnership, which averaged the Dow Jones Industrial Average by 9.1% between 1957 and 1968. Warren Buffet disbanded the Buffet Partnership and began concentrating its investment on Berkshire Hathaway. The performance of the new company was huge, as the book value of the shares in 1965 was $ 19.46 and at the end of 2007 it was $ 78,008, which is a return percentage of 21.1 at the annual 43-year earnings. No other investor has surpassed Buffet in its profitability when investing in stocks. It still maintains a leading position among the richest people in the world. <strong>According to Forbes, Warren Buffet is currently the 6th richest man with a Net Worth of $ 96 billion.</strong>
</p>
<p>Warren Buffet considered himself a disciple of Benjamin Graham, but unlike him, **Buffet also made his investment decisions based on a subjective feeling. **Buffet did not find Graham's above-mentioned investment strategy profitable enough, so he adopted his own rules and principles of investing. Unlike Buffet, Graham was very careful because he experienced the financial crisis of 1929. The investor should approach the purchase of new shares as if he wanted to buy the whole company, or if he inherited the whole company, and it was the investor's only asset. In such a case, it would be absolutely necessary to analyze the financial situation, get to know the competition and customers.</p>
<p><strong>Buffet recommends choosing so-called inevitables among joint-stock companies</strong>
. Such companies will be leaders in the industry throughout the investment. However, be aware that the current dominant position in the market does not guarantee this position forever. Companies like General Motors, Kodak or Sears were also invincible at the time. The great advantage of an individual investor is that he can wait for his great investment in the shares of an international company. Unlike portfolio managers, they do not have to invest regularly every month, or even every year.</p>
<p><strong>Buffet has big reservations about active trading, where the investor often buys and sells shares</strong>
. The hyperactive stock market discreetly robs investors and companies, and the only ones who profit from it are brokers. Billions of dollars are paid to NYSE and NASDAQ brokers every year. Unreasonable reasons for getting rid of shares are, for example, an increase in the discount rate by the Federal Reserve System by 25 basis points, receiving a hot tip for other shares, holding a share for a longer period or sufficient appreciation of the share. The reason for the sale should be a change in the company's fundamentals or the finding of an error in the evaluation of the quality of management, or an estimate of the future economic results of 48 companies. <strong>Warren Buffet emphasizes that it is better to buy a high-quality company at a reasonable price than to buy an average company at a significantly low price.</strong>
</p>
<span class="post-quote">"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price."</span>

<Title>Nasdaq tests 50-day moving average as Evergrande's default looms</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>At the time of writing, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index was seen slightly below the critical 50-day moving average (15,190 USD). Closing below that level could change the short-term outlook to bearish.</p>
<h2>Evergrande sends ripples through the financial world</h2>
<p><strong>The Chinese real estate giant Evergrande will likely default this week, possibly causing some tremors in the financial markets</strong>
 as several US banks have significant exposure against Evergrande and the whole sector in China.</p>
<p>The company is scheduled to pay 83.5 million USD of interest on September 23 for its offshore March 2022 bond. Then, it has another 47.5 million USD interest payment due on September 29 for March 2024 bonds.</p>
<p>However, Evergrande is scheduled to pay interest on bank loans Monday, with a one-day grace period. In other words, should it fail to arrange an extension of today's payments, it could be in technical default as soon as Tuesday.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Evergrande should not cause another Lehman effect, even if it goes to bankruptcy. <strong>The company has more than 300 billion USD in debt, but the systemic risk should be limited.</strong>

The fall of Evergrande may also affect the business' ability to finance and issue bonds, thus bringing further chaos to China's real estate market and another "Lehman storm."</p>
<span class="post-quote">"However, unlike the US market in 2007 to 2008, China's does not have too many complicated financial products that can affect housing market operations and Beijing's ability to control and monitor the market is better than the United States," </span>
<span class="quote-author">the Hong Kong-based media outlet, The Standard, said on Monday.</span>
<p>There are no macro data on the agenda later in the session. Thus the current bearish sentiment might persist throughout the day.</p>
<p>Typically, when the market is in decline, several FOMC members start delivering speeches to calm investors. We expect similar behavior during this week if sentiment does not improve soon. Especially as <strong>the Fed decides about monetary policy this week, with the results known on late Wednesday.</strong>
</p>
<h2>Bulls need to make a move right now</h2>
<p>The index is currently testing the key support area – the 50-day average converged with previous highs near 15,170 USD. <strong>If the price drops below 15,170 USD and closes there on a daily basis, it could mean a notable reversal in the current medium-term trend.</strong>
</p>
<p>In such a case, stop-losses of long positions will be hit, possibly dragging the index further lower. As a result, the next target for bears is expected at August lows near 14,800 USD.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if bulls reappear, they need to push the index above the short-term downtrend line, which is currently near 15,400 USD, to cancel the immediate bearish momentum. Until that happens, the short-term outlook appears bearish.</p>

<Title>Silver forms a bullish reversal pattern</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Silver has been beaten up recently, <strong>sliding from 24 USD to 22 USD, or 8%, in a matter of days.</strong>
 The price dropped below July’s lows and fell to fresh ten-month lows, but now it looks like sentiment might be turning.</p>
<p>Later in the day, US building permits will be released, expected to decrease slightly to 1.61 million in August, down from 1.63 million in July. Housing starts are forecast to rise somewhat, from 1.53 million to 1.58 million annualized. Lastly, the US current account deficit should narrow slightly, according to estimates.</p>
<p>None of these data usually impact silver, but they might cause some volatility in the USD and possibly influence precious metals.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Silver bars or ingots background, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<h2>Dovish or hawkish Fed?</h2>
<p>More importantly, <strong>the Fed starts its two-day meeting today, and we will find out the results of this meeting tomorrow</strong>
. Previously, investors had anticipated the central bank to announce tapering at this month’s meeting. However, considering the recent weakness in the economic data, mainly in the labor market, the Fed might set a date for tapering to November.</p>
<p><strong>The latest sell-off in stock markets and volatility might also push the Fed to a more cautious tone</strong>
 as the central bank does not want to risk a more extensive correction in equities. The Fed should acknowledge that the time for reducing asset purchases nears, but it is not expected to make any hawkish projections for rates, despite soaring inflation.</p>
<span class="post-quote">Markets may be sensitive to any signals about the timing of monetary tightening. It is quite a close call, but we do not expect the Median Dot Plot for the first-rate hike to shift from 2023 to 2022. That would ultimately underpin Powell’s recent rhetoric around the de-linking of tapering and tightening and keep rate expectations capped. In FX, this should translate into a weaker dollar after the FOMC announcement, </span>
<span class="quote-author">economists at ING wrote in a research note Tuesday.</span>
<p>Should the USD start another leg lower, it might be positive for silver, especially since the daily chart is currently looking bullish.</p>
<h2>Charts point to a possible bounce</h2>
<p>As previously said, silver dropped below July’s lows, killing all the stop-losses below this essential support. However, the bearish pressure has eased immediately, and it looks like a short-term bullish momentum is forming.</p>
<p><strong>That is a well-known reversal formation, known as a bearish trap or a false breakdown.</strong>
 The focus of this formation is to cause maximum pain for most of the traders, ie. Tagging stop-losses of long positions and squeezing new short positions opened on the breakdown.</p>
<p>Should silver close above July’s lows at 22.35 USD, the pattern could be confirmed, potentially starting a short-term leg higher. The target of this squeeze could be at previous lows near 23 USD.
Additionally, <strong>there is a nice bullish divergence between the MACD and the price, further supporting the bounce hypothesis.</strong>

<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.44%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.44%</strong>

 for price indexation. This means that we are in the middle of a declining phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>

<p>Since our last analysis, there have been more declining trends, with a maximum of <strong>5</strong>

<Title>Investro Tea: Week #38</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Improvement of self-driving cars?</h2>
<p>Elon Musk stated last week that drivers will be able to improve their self-driving Tesla cars. Jennifer Homendy, Chair of the National Transportation Safety Board said that it is important to solve basic questions regarding the safety of self-driving cars, before they make it to the cities and streets. Tesla was also contacted by other regulators to improve the self-driving capabilities of its cars and their overall safety. These warnings and many questionable remarks may have caused a drop of - 3 % of the shares of TSLA. If you want to know more about this topic do not hesitate and read this entry from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-19/u-s-investigator-urges-tesla-to-fix-self-driving-concerns-wsj">Bloomberg</a>

<h2>Problems of Evergrande</h2>
<p>Indices, stocks, commodities or cryptocurrencies have all suffered losses this week due to the fears connected to Chinese property company Evergrande Group. Eventhough the Chinese government has stepped in and should provide a stimulus to bail this company out, we are not out of the woods yet.</p>
<p>According to Jenny Zeng of Alliance Bernstein Evergrande is still on a verge of bankruptcy, which could lead to domino effect in the Chinese markets, especially in properties. Evergrande has the debt of 310 billion dollars and is the most indebted property company in the world.</p>

<Title>USD/JPY expects FOMC outcome near 109.50</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The USD/JPY pair traded firmer on Wednesday afternoon, supported mainly by the dovish Japanese central bank. However, all could change very quickly today as traders are getting ready for the outcome of the FOMC meeting.</p>
<h2>Bank of Japan sounds dovish</h2>
<p>During the Asian session, the Bank of Japan left monetary policy unchanged. Still, <strong>it sounded somewhat dovish, contrasting with other major central banks currently expected to tighten monetary policy.</strong>
</p>
<p>Additionally, the central bank said that household spending remains weak due to coronavirus measures, state of emergency curbs. Lastly, people's cautious activity under coronavirus is weighing on consumption.</p>
<p>Following the policy meeting, the <strong>Bank of Japan's Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated that the central bank would ease policy further without hesitation if needed</strong>
, sending the USDJPY pair above the 109.50 resistance.</p>
<h2>FOMC to move the markets</h2>
<p>Later in the day, <strong>the crucial FOMC meeting concludes, with investors expecting the Fed to announce when it is ready to scale back asset purchases,</strong>
 known as tapering. The official consensus thinks the month will be November.</p>
<p>However, considering the recent weakness in the labor market data and the recent sell-off in stocks, the Fed might delay the decision until December or the following year. That would be taken as a very dovish signal, potentially sending stocks higher but diving the greenback.</p>
<p>Additionally, the other components of monetary policy should remain unchanged, with the Fed most likely keeping long-term interest rates expectations near record lows.</p>
<span class="post-quote">Given the global outlook is that bit more uncertain with growth expectations being lowered and given the flow of economic data has been somewhat disappointing in the US, the FOMC is unlikely to spring another DOT shock. That could prove disappointing for those with long USD/JPY positions, </span>
<span class="quote-author">economists at MUFG bank turned bearish on the USD/JPY pair.</span>
<h2>Daily chart remains neutral</h2>
<p>The USD/JPY pair has not moved anywhere over the previous months, and the symmetrical triangle pattern remains intact. However, there are many false breaks above or below it, diminishing the importance of this pattern.</p>
<p><strong>The immediate resistance seems to be near the 109.90 zone</strong>
, where the 50-day moving average is converged with the bearish trend line of the triangle. Thus, the next target could be near 110.30, followed by the current cycle highs above 111.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the USD drops after today's FOMC decision, <strong>the support could be found at this week's lows near 109.15,</strong>
 followed by the next demand zone at August's lows of 108.80.</p>

<Title>EUR/USD jumps despite hawkish Fed</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The greenback failed to hold yesterday's gains and was sold-off notably on Thursday, pushing the EUR/USD pair back above the 1.17 threshold, erasing all the post-FOMC gains.</p>
<h2>Fed turns hawkish</h2>
<p>Wednesday's FOMC decision brought a hawkish surprise and caught some investors off-guard. <strong>The Fed appears ready to start tapering in November</strong>
, although they did not confirm November as the GO month. Instead, the statement read: <strong>"a moderation in the pace of asset purchases may soon be warranted,"</strong>
 meaning it should begin in November or December.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <strong>tapering process is now expected to end in July 2022</strong>
 – a relatively quick process, considering the recent weakness in the labor market.</p>
<p>Regarding interest rates – the FOMC is now split 9-9 whether to raise rates next year. Thus, <strong>9 participants want to start the so-called lift-off next year</strong>
, probably due to the soaring inflation. As a result, only one FOMC member doesn't expect a rate rise by the end of 2023, a substantial change from just six months ago.</p>
<span class="post-quote">On the whole, the Fed meeting was another move in the "more hawkish direction." even if the bank clarified that "this is still a very dovish Fed that is highly committed to achieving higher inflation and a hot economy. But in the face of supply-side constraints and growing signs of persistent inflation, it appears that those objectives could be met earlier,</span>
<span class="quote-author">BofA chief economist Michelle Meyer said post FOMC.</span>
<p>As previously said, the USD strengthened after the FOMC decision but gave up all gains on Thursday.</p>
<h2>EU data disappoint</h2>
<p>Given the very weak German (and EU) data this morning, the euro's resilience is even more surprising.</p>
<p><strong>German services PMI for September fell to 56 from 60.8 in August, while the manufacturing sector dropped to 58.5 from 62.6 previously</strong>
, suggesting a weak end of the third quarter in the eurozone.</p>
<p>Additionally, the eurozone's services sector slowed notably, from 59 to 56.3, and the manufacturing PMI declined to 58.7, from 61.7 scored in August.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Detail of USD and EURO banknotes, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<h2>US data in focus now</h2>
<p>Later in the day, the usual Thursday's jobless claims will be released. Initial claims should improve further to 320,000 from last week's 332,000. Meanwhile, continuing claims are expected to slide a bit to 2.65 million, from 2.665 million scored in the previous report.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>the US Markit manufacturing PMI for September is due, forecast to improve to 62.5 versus 61.1 recently, while the services sector is also expected to rise to 59.5, from 55.1 in August</strong>
. That would be a big divergence between the EU and US data (as EU data deteriorated notably and US data are expected to improve notably), possibly supporting the bearish case in the EUR/USD pair.</p>

<Title>Banks “to the rescue”, declines in the markets and other news</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>This news led to an immediate decline in Chinese stock indices, later on, fear spread to markets around the world. Gradually, classic indices such as the S&P500, and Dow Jones, as well as for cryptocurrencies, also began to decline. Shortly after, the central banks began to react. China's central bank was the first to respond, providing $ 18.6 billion in liquidity.</p>
<p>At the traditional meeting yesterday, the Fed itself calmed the situation. According to the US central bank, the major interest rates will not be rising yet. As for the purchase of bonds, benefits will soon be reduced there. This mild rhetoric by Fed was mirrored by growth in markets.</p>
<h2>Key zones on S&P500 chart</h2>
<p>This chart clearly shows why many people immediately started thinking in terms of crisis. After a very long time, the S&P500 fell through the trend. Furthermore, the Evergrande case is very similar to the case of 2008, when the collapse of Lehmann Brothers caused a global crisis. Be that as it may, there is a strong line between a correction and a crisis. I have marked two basic levels that the S&P500 should maintain. This is a level of <strong>4269</strong>
 and <strong>4057</strong>
 points. These are really two strong swing levels that the S&P500 should maintain. If we keep them, we can be sure that what we have here is a correction, not a bear market.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: SP500 on a daily chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In a few months' time, I am also waiting for a deeper correction, and perhaps I would dare say even a crisis. However, I do not think it will be because of this case. In my opinion, the Evergrande case is only intended to scare people into selling. As long as central banks come to the rescue, the situation is relatively safe.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Due to the Evergrand case, we did not start off on a right foot this week. This Chinese giant has got the market into an uneasy situation, to say the least. That is because on Monday, it was stated that Evergrande did not have the capital to continue paying its liabilities in the amount of $ 310 billion.</Excerpt>

<Title>GBP/USD forms a triple bottom pattern</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Sterling rose notably Thursday, following the Bank of England tapering decision, and it has been trading flat so far on Friday, awaiting Powell's speech. At the time of writing, it was seen at around 1.3700.</p>
<h2>Hawkish Bank of England sends sterling higher</h2>
<p>The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England (BoE) left policy unchanged Thursday. However, <strong>the central bank announced plans to start reducing its asset purchases.</strong>
 Tapering will begin soon and should end in December 2022. <strong>The MPC also noted that the case for tightening had increased since August</strong>
 and that a rate hike before they conclude QE in December can't be ruled out.</p>
<p>Since inflation is running high, the BoE might be one of the more responsible central banks, and it could start tightening monetary policy the soonest. On the other hand, the economic data in the UK have deteriorated notably, creating a challenging environment for raising rates. Nevertheless, <strong>market participants now expect two rate hikes throughout the following year</strong>
. The GBP/USD pair rose circa 80 pips after the decision.</p>
<span class="post-quote">The risk that the BoE could hike before QE ends is notable, and one we do not dismiss easily. We think that is enough to help GBP trade on its front-foot for the time being, though the magnitude remains elusive,</span>
<span class="quote-author">Economists at TD Securities said Friday.</span>
<h2>All eyes on Powell, again</h2>
<p>Later today, the calendar is relatively empty, offering only new home sales, which rarely cause any market volatility.</p>
<p>However, all focus will be on <strong>the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who will deliver opening remarks at an online event hosted by the Federal Reserve.</strong>
 Mr. Powell might offer more information about the current situation in the Fed, where 50% of the FOMC members want to start raising rates next year.</p>
<p>Additionally, he might talk about the tapering plans and when precisely the process will begin, as the Fed failed to provide a specific date at its latest meeting. Volatility will most likely be elevated during and after his speech.</p>
<h2>Triple bottom on a daily chart</h2>
<p>Yesterday's massive rally from the 1.36 support documented its importance, and now it looks like an impressive triple bottom pattern, which is a robust bullish formation.</p>
<p>Once again, the target for bulls is at previous highs and lows in the 1.38 area. The 50-day moving average is also located precisely there. The key resistance stands at the psychological level of 1.40.
<strong>There is also a bullish divergence between the MACD and price, supporting the bullish outlook.</strong>
</p>
<p>The medium-term trend remains neutral as long as the pair trades within the 1.36 – 1.40 range. In case of a bullish breakout, sterling might attack previous cycle highs at 1.42. Alternatively, if the Pound drops below 1.36, it might revisit the 1.33 support.</p>

<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What you need to know</h2>
<p>Trading and price development is a game of psychology. As you could clearly see this week, the emotions were up. In addition to the negative news, there were also some positive ones, for example, the one about Twitter. Be that as it may, nothing fundamental has changed on the chart and that is what matters. However, next time, if you see the confusion on the chart and do not know how to handle it, just switch to the daily chart to see the whole picture.</p>
<p>Now back to the daily chart at hand. We can see some key levels. As long as we keep support at <strong>$ 40,000</strong>
, we are still bullish. Overcoming this support would be very bad. According to Alessio Rastani, we can easily reach up to <strong>$ 37,000</strong>
 without any serious ramifications. Overcoming this support, however, would be really negative. So from below, we are supported by <strong>$ 37,000 - $ 40,000</strong>
. As long as we keep above this level, everything is fine. As for the confirmation of the bull market, Bitcoin needs to clearly overcome the trend now. Once this happens we can continue to say that the trend will continue.</p>
<p>Once we create a higher HIGH and close above <strong>$ 52,800</strong>
, there is a huge chance that Bitcoin will go up to <strong>$ 80,000 - $ 100,000</strong>
.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Bitcoin on a daily chart</span>
<p>This is absolutely crucial at the moment. All movements in this range between support and trend serve only to confuse you.</p>
<h2>And what about the 4H graph?</h2>
<p>As for the 4H chart, it will become bullish once the price gets above the trend line. Until we are there, there is still the possibility to touch the support line by a wick. However, the main goal now is to maintain the support line at all costs.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Bitcoin on a 4H chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>No need to be worried now. Trading is a game of emotions and institutions do their best to win it. However, you need to be smarter and not to play this game with them.</p>

<Excerpt>This week was marked by a decline in cryptocurrencies. The first decline came on Monday due to the Chinese company Evergrande, which led to a decline not only in cryptocurrencies but in world markets in general. Today, bad news came again from China regarding the legality of transactions.</Excerpt>

<Title>Crude Oil (WTI) statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.76%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.96%,</strong>
 respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.91%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.93%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>0.93%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>3</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. Therefore, it is currently in a positive extreme phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated development of cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210924_Cycles_fc8c6ae1ae.jpg" alt="WTI daily price indexation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. As we can see in the chart below, all <strong>WTI</strong>
 MAs currently support bullish sentiment. In the event of a decline, the monthly MA may be the price support.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/210924_Mo_M_c653431df0.jpg" alt="WTI daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, there have been stronger downward trends with a maximum level of <strong>6</strong>
 consecutive days, even the market price is currently higher. The maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>11</strong>
 days. Upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>3</strong>
 days in the same period. However, the maximum increase was <strong>8</strong>
 days in the measured period. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.32%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.33%</strong>
, which is below the average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.60%</strong>
 and <strong>3.60%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>6.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to a positive short-term sentiment after rebounding from the demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
, along with the psychological level of <strong>60.00</strong>
. The short-term MA also supported the WTI last week. However, there is a divergence between price development and the RSI that has developed in recent months. The psychological level of <strong>77.00</strong>
 could be an important resistance if the market price rises higher.</p>

<Excerpt>The change in the number of crude oil barrels held in inventory has been falling for seven weeks in a row. The lack of supply also pushes the price higher. The current price of Crude Oil (WTI) is 73.98 (September 24, 2021). This commodity is currently aimed at testing this year’s highs. Let us therefore look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>Five habits of everyday millionaires</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Five simple, but not easy, steps</h2>
<p>If becoming a millionaire was easy, everyone would become one. Its the same as with becoming professional athletes or experts in any given field. Getting into the top tier in anything requires determination and persistence as well as clear vision of your goals and dreams. And we are well aware how corny all of this sounds, but as Chris Hogan, author of the book "Everyday Millionaire" showed, these simple, but not easy, steps can lead to a vast improvement of your financial situation that can even lead to becoming a millionaire. What exactly are these steps? More important question though is, what is the relationship of these everyday millionaires towards their money? What do they do and others do not?</p>
<h3>1.Have a plan</h3>
<p>Everyday millionaires have their plans when it comes to money. They use all the means necessary to increase their wealth over time mostly through passive income. For instance they know how they can use 401k or 403b (this is mostly concerned about US investors). But it can be applied to anyone, since this point simply means that you have to be in charge of your money and have to know where is it that you want to go in the financial sphere.</p>
<h3>2.Spend less</h3>
<p>Extremely important point especially in this world full of unnecessary consumption. Spending less than earning means that you are not only not living out of debt, but also that you might be able to put some money aside (ideally invest), which can by itself lead to a passive income over time. According to the findings of Chris Hogan, 94 % of millionaires live on less than they make. The message here is clear.</p>
<h3>3.Look for deals</h3>
<p>Probably the most surprising point, but even millionaires look for deals. They use coupons or sales to get stuff that they need for less money. And why would not they? It is not like it is shameful to be spending less than you actually could on some stuff in stores. Financially, this decision is really smart and can give you a chance to put aside more money.</p>
<h3>4.Make a budget</h3>
<p>One of the more difficult points for sure, but it is without any doubt crucial. Knowing how much you spent last month or how much you can spend next month gives you a chance to know how much you can invest and grow your portfolio of financial assets. Without budget, which will lead to awareness in your spending, it is very difficult to improve your financial situation.</p>
<h3>5.Stay in control</h3>
<p>Making a budget is not enough though. Staying in line with your budget is. Doing the thing that you said you are going to do is important not only to show selfcontrol and selfawareness, but it can also make you believe that you are the one, who is in charge of your own destiny. And this is obviously very true, and according to Chris Hogan, 97 % of everyday millionaires do believe that as well.</p>
<p>Do you find all of these points fascinating and you want to learn more? Feel free to check <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/11/18/how-to-go-from-humble-origins-to-wealthy-by-investing-over-time.html">this video</a>
 at CNBC, where you can find more information about each of the five habits of everyday millionaires.</p>

<Excerpt>Who would not want to become a millionaire? Well maybe a billionaire, but not a lot of people are born billionaires. Vast majority of people is far from being millionaires. What should they do if they want to change it?</Excerpt>

<Title>EUR/JPY trades below 130 after German elections</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The EUR/JPY cross showed little desire for volatility on Monday and remained pinned to the 130 level as the euro declined after the German elections, but the Yen also dropped following Kuroda's speech.</p>
<h2>Negative outlook in Japan</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) <strong>Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said that the economic recovery would become clearer as the impact of the pandemic subsides</strong>
. Additionally, he noted that Japan's economy remains in a severe state but picking up as a trend.</p>
<p>On monetary policy, <strong>Kuroda reiterated that the BOJ wouldn't hesitate to take additional easing steps if needed</strong>
. Lastly, the central bank must continue focusing on pandemic response as economic uncertainty remains high.</p>
<p>A rather negative speech (economic uncertainty combined with COVID restrictions & dovish monetary policy) sent the USD/JPY to three-month highs near 111. Still, the EUR/JPY cross remained flat due to the EUR/USD weakness.</p>
<p><strong>More JPY volatility could come during the Asian session on Tuesday. The Bank of Japan will release the minutes from its latest monetary policy decision</strong>
, which sounded relatively dovish and undermined the Yen.</p>
<h2>German elections in focus</h2>
<p>Sunday's German elections brought a little surprise as the center-left Social Democratic Party won with 26% of the votes, according to the preliminary results, two percentage points ahead of the center-right Christian Democratic bloc. As such, the party of the retiring Angela Merkel will likely go into opposition for the first time in 16 years.</p>
<p>The single currency dropped broadly after the results, dragging the EUR/USD pair below the 1.17 level. However, the dip seems to be bought, and the euro can't maintain an evident bearish momentum.</p>
<span class="post-quote">The wafer-thin margin of victory for the SPD creates even more uncertainty over the likely formation of the next government and leaves an array of potential coalition options still on the table. Coalitions talks are expected to take weeks and possibly months. The continued uncertainty is one reason why there has been limited euro reaction to the initial election results,</span>
<span class="quote-author">Strategists at MUFG Bank commented on the results.</span>
<p>As of importance today will be <strong>ECB President Christine Lagarde's testimony before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs</strong>
. Her speech might impact the shared currency.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>US durable goods orders for August will be released, expected to improve notably to 0.7% from -0.1% previously</strong>
. However, core durable goods are forecast to weaken slightly, from 0.8% to 0.5%.</p>
<p>Considering those numbers are the only major economic news on the agenda today, we might see some volatility in the financial markets.</p>

<Title>Gold drops to six-week lows amid surging yields</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The bullion fell to fresh six-week lows on Tuesday, trading more than 1% lower ahead of the US session and seen at around 1,730 USD at the time of writing.</p>
<p><strong>US yields have spiked higher recently, sending the 10-year yield to the psychological 1.5% level</strong>
, but the whole yield curve has risen notably, indicating a broad selloff in the bond market. Rising yields are often bearish for precious metals but bullish for the greenback.</p>
<p>The dollar index has managed to capitalize on rising yields, at least so far, and it advanced to one-year highs today, trading above 93.50, the level last seen in early November 2020.</p>
<h2>Fed becoming hawkish</h2>
<p>Later in the session, <strong>the Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powel will testify about the Coronavirus and CARES Act before the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in Washington, DC.</strong>
 His remarks will be closely watched, as always. Considering the recent hawkish shift at the Fed today, the greenback might be further supported by his words. His testimony will continue tomorrow.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <strong>St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard was out with some comments, saying that he sees two rate increases in 2022.</strong>
 The balance sheet should begin declining as soon as bond purchases end. Additionally, he thinks that the Fed policy normalization can move faster than following the 2007 to 2009 crisis, given the recovery speed.</p>
<p><strong>Should the dollar continue moving higher, precious metals will most likely continue to decline.</strong>
 Silver is already on the verge of dropping below the essential 22 USD support, possibly opening space for a massive decline toward 18.50, where pre-COVID highs are located.</p>
<p>From other macro data, the US consumer confidence index for September is due today, along with the Richmond Fed manufacturing index. Unfortunately, both data rarely have any impact on gold or silver.</p>
<h2>Bearish bias confirmed</h2>
<p>As the bullion dropped to new swing lows, the bearish trend has been confirmed, especially if gold closes below 1,740 USD on the daily chart. Therefore, the first initial resistance is at 1,740 USD, followed by the selling area near 1,760 USD. Gold needs to climb above 1,760 USD for the immediate selling pressure to ease.</p>
<p>On the downside, <strong>the next target for bears is expected to be at 1,720 USD</strong>
, and the medium-term target remains near August’s flash-crash lows at 1,680 USD. Additionally, as long as the bullion trades below the long-term uptrend line (the purple line on the chart), the long-term bull market is no longer valid. The medium and short-term timeframes also look bearish.</p>

<Title>USD/JPY trades at cycle highs ahead of Powell's testimony</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The greenback was broadly higher on Wednesday, pushing the USD/JPY pair to three-month highs at 111.50, where the current bull market cycle highs are located. Should the USD continue through this resistance, the long-term uptrend might be renewed.</p>
<h2>Hawkish Powell again</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, markets focused on the Fed Chair Jerome Powell testimony. <strong>He seemed to hint that the shift in inflation is not just 'transitory' but could be 'structural,' leading to the repricing of the expectations for even more hawkish for Fed action</strong>
. As a result, <strong>there is now a greater than 50% probability of a rate hike in September 2022, up from the 30% just a week ago</strong>
.
Later in the session, the second day of Jerome Powell's testimony occurs, and volatility could be elevated throughout and after the event.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>ECB President Christine Lagarde will participate in a virtual panel discussion titled "Policy panel" at the ECB Forum</strong>
 on Central Banking. The BoE's Bailey and the BoJ's Kuroda will also speak at the conference, possibly influencing the financial markets.</p>
<p>Lastly, US pending homes sales figures will be released, but these data rarely impact the FX market.</p>
<h2>Rising yields support higher USD/JPY</h2>
<p>The USD/JPY pair is generally tightly correlated to the US yields. Since the 10-year yield rocketed from 1.3% to 1.55% in a matter of days, the USD/JPY pair also jumped higher.</p>
<p><strong>As long as the 10-year yield defends the 1.5% level, the short-term outlook appears bullish for yields</strong>
, targeting the 1.7% from the medium-term perspective, most likely pushing the USD/JPY pair toward the 115 level.</p>
<p>However, should the yield correct to the next support at 1.39%, it could lead to profit-taking in USDJPY, possibly dragging it lower to 110.50.</p>

<span class="post-quote">With US yields having completed near-term bases and expected to rise further, we continue to look for a test on long-term resistance, starting at the 111.66 June YTD high and stretching up to the 2019 and 2020 highs at 112.40 and 112.23 respectively,</span>

<Title>Best Buy (BBY) - basic stock analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>2.37%</strong>
 and <strong>-2.18%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>1.13%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.01%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was only <strong>0.04%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>2</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the short-term positive phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. As we can see in the chart below, all MAs are still in bearish sentiment. In the case of growth, the annual MA can be an important resistance to the market price.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Our estimated Earnings Power Value (EPV) is <strong>164 USD</strong>
 and the Growth Value (GV) is approximately <strong>228 USD</strong>
. The potential opportunity for growth is based on the value of EPV and % of reinvested earnings. NAV is represented by the Total Stockholders' equity. The following chart uses the value from the last fiscal year.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the average ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>2.79%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.99%</strong>
, which is very close to the average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-4.80%</strong>
 and <strong>4.80%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>6.75%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis still points to almost a year of sideways trading. The channel is created from approximately <strong>100</strong>
 to <strong>120 USD</strong>
. Very strong technical support could be the psychological level of <strong>105 USD</strong>
, where the last rebound also took place. In addition, we can clearly see a bullish divergence between the market price and the RSI. Volumes were also above average on Monday. The <strong>BBY</strong>
 is currently approaching the important psychological level of <strong>110 USD</strong>
 and the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
. Both moving averages could be a resistance to the market price in the event of further growth.</p>

<Title>Markets bombarded by a barrage of economic data on Thursday</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The financial markets continued in their short-term trends Thursday, meaning US yields moved higher, sending precious metals lower, while most of the FX pairs showed gains for the greenback.</p>
<h2>Data during Asian session</h2>
<p>Thursday started with investors looking at Japanese data, where industrial production on a yearly basis slipped to 9.3% from 11.6% previously, but monthly change dived deeper into negative territory. In addition, Japan's Retail trade year-on-year crashed to -3.2% in July, down from 2.4% in June. The Japanese economy remains under restrictions due to the latest COVID outbreak. The central bank and Japanese Prime Minister-elect Fumio Kishida said they need to do more to get the country out of the crisis.</p>
<p>Important Chinese data were also released during the Asian session. The non-manufacturing PMI improved markedly in September and rose to 53.2 from 47.5 in August. Furthermore, the manufacturing PMI rose to 50.0, from 49.2 in the last month. Improving Chinese numbers lifted sentiment, leading to small rallies in equity indices and commodities.</p>
<h2>EU economic numbers</h2>
<p>During the EU session, traders focused on the UK GDP data. The Office for National Statistics informed that the domestic economy grew 5.5% in the second quarter, better than expected and a notable improvement from the 1.6% decline in the previous quarter. However, despite the upbeat data, the Pound failed to start any meaningful rally, and it remained muted, trading near 1.3440, down 300 pips over the previous days.</p>
<p>Germany released its unemployment rate and unemployment change for September. The first stayed unchanged at 5.5%, while the latter improved marginally, from -53,000 to -30,000. Germany's inflation data will also be released today, possibly influencing the EUR/USD pair or the German DAX index.</p>
<h2>US calendar also full</h2>
<p>Later today, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell continues to testify with US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen about the Coronavirus and CARES Act before the Committee on Financial Services, US House of Representatives, in Washington DC. Unless they talk about "something new," financial markets should not be impacted, considering it is the third day of the testimony.</p>
<p>The US session will also bring the usual Thursday jobless claims. Initial claims are expected to fall notably, from 351,000 to 335,000, while continuing claims should also decline to 2.8 million from 2.845 million scored in the previous week.</p>
<p>Lastly, the final revision of the US Q2 GDP will be released, forecast to stay at 6.5%. Therefore, unless there is some significant deviation in the final number, market volatility should not be elevated.</p>
<p>As previously said, the ongoing trends in the markets might remain intact, meaning more US dollar strength and higher US yields.
More near-term DXY upside is likely now that US real rates are more forcefully repricing the Fed’s Nov/Dec QE taper signal and the hawkish reshuffling of their dots, economists at Westpac reported today.</p>

<Title>Indices are falling. Is this the beginning of something bigger?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>In recent days, both of these indices had gone into correction while violating their structure. The question at hand remains, is this just a temporary correction or should we be worried?</p>
<h2>S&P500</h2>
<p>As for the S&P500, we fell through a long-term trend line that was kept intact for several months. However, if you go through my recent analyzes, you will find that I assumed that something similar would happen. And then the price went down right through the trend line.</p>
<p>The key zone is currently at <strong>$ 4486 - $ 4516</strong>
. Why is this zone important? Because in order to even think in the terms of a bullish market, we need to overcome it. Unless we get out of here, we can forget about growth as we are still in a correction. Truth to be told, the chart was indeed trying to get back up after the slump but all efforts were promptly stopped by the mentioned key zone.</p>
<p>At the moment, I see but two scenarios. Both of them being more or less bearish. The first scenario is a triangle. This means that the S&P500 would now form a triangle and then probably would still fall to somewhere around <strong>4269</strong>
 points.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/Stock_indices_30_9_1_6b9ec6b458.png" alt="SP500 on 4H chart">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: S&P500 on a 4H chart with visible key zone</span>
<h2>NASDAQ</h2>
<p>With NASDAQ, it is similar here. It also fell through the long-term trend. However, the NASDAQ has waited with its slump for a bit longer. If we were to look at individual stocks in the whole sector, we would find that the technological stocks went into correction a bit later on. This is exactly what can be seen in this chart.</p>
<p>Here, it is absolutely crucial for us to overcome the level of <strong>196</strong>
 points. Only after that, can we think of continuing the bull market. However, as long as we are below this level and in the channel, there is a high probability that the price will come closer to the level of <strong>184 - 186</strong>
 points.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: NASDAQ on a 4H chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As charts have shown us, the growth rate has clearly run out of power and we are starting to decline. At the moment, however, it is impossible to say whether this decline can be ascribed only to the normal correction or whether it will be something more serious. However, the Fed is actively responding to change and up to this point, it has always saved the market. I assume that the correction will continue, but as soon as a bigger threat appears on the horizon, the Fed will intervene and release more liquidity into the market, which will pull it back up.</p>

<Title>AUD/USD strengthens, dollar eases amid profit-taking</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The AUD/USD pair traded more than half a percent stronger during Friday's session, last seen near 0.7270. Investors took some profits from the recent US dollar rally, which brought the greenback lower Friday against all its major peers. However, it looks like the medium-term uptrend in US yields and USD might continue in the following days.</p>
<h2>RBA remains dovish</h2>
<p>The RBA continues to have a dovish tone. However, it plans to taper its QE program, starting in September amid expectations that the economy will bounce quickly once restrictions are lifted. But are they ever going to be lifted?</p>
<span class="post-quote">The RBA has become surprisingly prescriptive in its view that wages will need to be growing by at least 3% to push CPI inflation sustainably into the middle of the 2% to 3% target band. This will then trigger a rise in the Cash rate. It is the Bank's view that this will not happen before 2024. This dovish outlook is likely to restrain the AUD, </span>
<span class="quote-author">Economists at Rabobank think.</span>
<h2>US data not helping USD today</h2>
<p>In the USA, the Fed's favorite inflation indicator - <strong>The core PCE index - rose 3.6% year-over-year (unchanged from July but hotter than the expected 3.5% YoY)</strong>
. According to this measure, inflation remains at 30-year highs and shows no signs of falling back toward the 2% target.</p>
<p>From other news, personal income declined notably to 0.2% in August, down from 1.1% in July, while personal spending improved sharply, from -0.1% to 0.8%.</p>
<p>Later today, <strong>the ISM manufacturing index is expected to marginally decline to 59.6, from 59.9 in the previous month</strong>
. However, the employment index will most likely improve to 50.9.</p>
<p>It appears that the benchmark 10-year US yield has topped at 1.5%, at least from the short-term perspective, undermining the USD and giving some relief to other currencies, such as the Pound, Euro, or the Australian dollar.</p>
<h2>Medium-term unclear</h2>
<p>Unlike many other USD pairs, the AUDUSD pair has not declined to new swing lows. Thus the bearish trend has not been confirmed yet. <strong>The immediate resistance stands in the 0.7320 region, where the 50-day moving average is converged with previous lows and highs</strong>
. That is the crucial level for the Aussie.</p>
<p>The medium-term outlook might change to bullish if it jumps above it, targeting the current swing highs near 0.7480.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the bearish pressure returns and the resistance is defended, bears will most likely have two targets in their minds: The first one at this week's lows at 0.7170 and the second one at the current cycle lows near 0.71.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin holds a chance at becoming bullish!</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Global perspective - what is crucial now</h2>
<p>The situation on Bitcoin has been quite paradoxical in the last 2 weeks. While from the fundamental standpoint, we have experienced quite an eventful 2 weeks, the chart remains unscathed. Why could that be?</p>
<p>That is because we need to pay attention also to technical analysis. And that is based, apart from other factors, on levels and zones. And those have not been broken through yet. We are still in a narrow range and we have not overcome any level that would tip the scales towards one side or another. Therefore, the chart not only remains the same but is also the most-watched one in the world of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>If the bull market is to continue, we must maintain the level of 37-40K. If we close below these levels, then there is a high chance that this will simply not happen.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: BTC on a daily chart</span>
<h2>4H graph</h2>
<p>The 4H chart is currently something I would not pay much attention to. For a very simple reason - it is indecisive. If someone were to decide based on the information obtained solely by looking at this chart, he could have experienced quite a mood swings, to say the least. We can see that the price is still in the triangle. Even though we have, in essence, already overcome the upper trend, I do not perceive it as a breakthrough. A genuine breakthrough from a triangle formation should come in the form of a hard candle with increased volumes. Unfortunately, I do not see this here. In addition, we are in the zone where the triangle, MA77, and day trend lines meet. I definitely do not consider this situation a triangle breakthrough rather I would say that it is 65% bullish and 35% bearish.</p>

<p>However, a look at the S&P500 chart is quite interesting, as it has fallen again significantly in the last few hours. Be that as it may, this had absolutely no effect on the price of cryptocurrencies which not only did not fall but rather grew. This factor also adds to the fact that the bull market is still in the game and that there is a chance that we will see a new ATH later this year.</p>

<Title>XPD/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.48%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.53%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.75%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.71%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>0.48%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-3</strong>
 for price indexation. It is currently in a very negative phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. The price of <strong>XPD/USD</strong>
 has been declining dynamically over the last month. All MAs therefore support bearish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/211002_Mo_M_f16b5ff253.jpg" alt="XPD/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, we have witnessed more declining trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>6</strong>
 consecutive days, which also represents the overall maximum in the measured period (last 3 years). The upward trends have not exceeded more than <strong>1</strong>
 day in the last period. However, the maximum in the measured period is <strong>14</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.20%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>3.86%</strong>
, which is slightly above average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.0%</strong>
 and <strong>3.0%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>5.25%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to volatile development since the beginning of this year. Three short-term dynamic corrections brought the price to an important zone. <strong>XPD/USD</strong>
 is currently well below both moving averages. However, it is in the long-term demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>78.60%</strong>
. In addition, a positive scenario could be supported by a divergence between the price development and the RSI. A further drop below the zone could result in a test of lows at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<Title>Lords of the markets: Jim Simons</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p><em>The Quant Trader, The Worlds smartest Billionaire</em>
 or, as his biography says, <em>The man who solved the market.</em>
  These are all the nicknames for Jim Simons, which he fully earned thanks his work and extremely successful career. In this article you will find 10 exciting points about his life as well as 3 interesting quotes of Jim Simons about the markets.</p>
<h3>10 points you need to know about Simons</h3>
<li>At the age of 17, Jim Simons started studying Mathematics at MIT. His career in academia only started there. He earned his doctorate at the age of 23 at University of Berkeley.</li>
<li>Chern-Simons form, which is an important mathematical theory played a crucial role in topological quantum field theory.</li>
<li>One of his first jobs was working for National Security Agency, where he was working as a code cracker during Vietnam War. However, due to differences in opinions about the war he was fired.</li>
<li>At the age of 44, the mathematician who had by then won many different awards and helped to made significant progress in the fields of mathematics (and later on in physics) has finally decided to use his knowledge and created the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies.</li>
<li>Renaissance Technologies and especially Jim Simons decided to use different approach to investing and trading. That is why most of the employees did not have background in finance. Most of them came from mathematical background, physics, statistics and IT.</li>
<li>Thanks to this special combination, Renaissance Technologies traded complex mathematical formulas, which at that time was extremely rare and rather pioneering approach to trading.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, his pioneering approach led to one of his fund, Medallion, which is part of the Renaissance Technologies, to earn more than 35 % for more than 20 year between 1994 and 2014.</li>
<li>Due to the success of his fund, Jim Simons was earning extreme amount of money. In 2019, his net worth was approximately 21,6 billion dollars. By 2021 it was approximately 23,5 billion dollars, making him not only the richest hedge fund manager, but also 23rd richest American.</li>
<li>Jim Simons has already made very charitable donations. According to some estimates he has already given about 3 billion dollars to charities.</li>
<li>All of his successes are captured in book that was solely written about his career. The book is named </li>
<em>The man who solved the market: How Jim Simons Launched the Quant Revolution.</em>
<li> We strongly recommend this book for anyone who wants to know more about one of the most successful hedge fund manager ever.</li>
<h3>Top 3 quotes of Jim Simons</h3>
<p>His career (just like his biography) was not only successful but also full of interesting quote. Some of the most important are below:</p>
<p><em>„Past performance is the best predictor of success.“</em>
</p>
<p><em>„In this business it´s easy to confuse luck with brains.“</em>
</p>
<p><em>„One can predict the course of a comet more easily than one can predict the course of Citigroup´s stock. The attractiveness, of course, is that you can make more money successfully predicting a stock than you can a comet.“</em>
</p>

<Title>DAX nears critical support again</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Sentiment worsened on Monday, sending stocks lower during the EU session. At the time of writing, US equity futures were down more than half a percent, while EU bourses were even weaker.</p>
<h2>No macro news today</h2>
<p>The macro calendar is relatively empty today – typical for Mondays. In the EU, <strong>the Sentix investor confidence index declined to 16.9 in October, down from 19.6 in September</strong>
, suggesting there might not be any autumn economic revival in the eurozone. The index declined to six-month lows and marked the third straight monthly decline. Additionally, the expectations subindex fell to 8.0 from 9.0, dropping for the fifth month in a row to hit its lowest level since May 2020.</p>
<p>Additionally, the European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos said Monday that the central bank would decide on the Pandemic Emergency Purchases Programme (PEPP) alternatives in December if needed.</p>
<span class="post-quote">Monetary policy will remain accommodative, but the goal is price stability. Expects inflation to keep rising for the next 2-3 months, Sees factors pushing up inflation fading in 2022,</span>
<span class="quote-author">quoting his remarks.</span>
<p>The EUR/USD pair has dropped notably, but it failed to support the DAX index. That is somewhat strange, considering there is usually a negative correlation between the euro and the DAX index (weaker euro typically leads to a stronger DAX and vice versa).</p>
<h2>Technical situation starting to look bad</h2>
<p><strong>The index is dropping toward the critical support near 15,040 EUR,</strong>
 where previous lows are located. The support has been already tested several times, and bulls have always managed to defend it. However, since rallies from this support have been mild, it looks like we could ultimately see a breakdown below the support.</p>
<p>Large stop-losses should be hit in that scenario, <strong>potentially pushing the index further lower in the initial reaction, targeting 14,830 EUR</strong>
 and changing the medium-term outlook to bearish.
The 50-day moving average is starting to slope downwards, and the index has been trading below it for several weeks. Additionally, **the RSI indicator is still far from oversold levels – supporting another leg lower. **</p>
<p>Alternatively, bulls need to push the index above 15,400 EUR to cancel the immediate bearish threat. Another level to watch will be at 15,630 EUR, where the 50-day average is located.</p>

<Title>Super Micro Computer (SMCI) - basic stock analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>2.09%</strong>
 and <strong>-2.10%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>1.07%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.98%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was only <strong>-1.26%</strong>
. Our scoring is currently negative (<strong>-1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the middle of a short-term negative phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. As we can see in the chart below, all MAs are still in bullish sentiment. Short- and medium-term MAs currently act as support for the market price.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Our estimated Earnings Power Value (EPV) is <strong>32 USD</strong>
 and the Growth Value (GV) is approximately the same. The potential opportunity for growth is based on the value of EPV and % of reinvested earnings. NAV is represented by the Total Stockholders' equity. The following chart uses the value from the last fiscal year.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.14%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>3.19%</strong>
, which is very close to the average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-4.00%</strong>
 and <strong>4.80%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to the stabilization phase, when we wait for the next dynamic movement up or down. The current market price is between the neutral (<strong>34 USD</strong>
 – blue highlight) and positive (<strong>40 USD</strong>
 – green highlight) scenario according to our estimate of intrinsic value. The negative scenario (<strong>31 USD</strong>
 – red highlight) estimates the intrinsic value in the demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>38.20%</strong>
. The psychological level of <strong>30.00</strong>
 can also be a very strong technical support. Both moving averages have been used to support the market price since the summer.</p>

<Title>AUD/JPY trying to start another bullish wave</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Sentiment was slightly positive Tuesday, as equities were trying to recover from the recent sell-off. That usually helps the AUD/JPY cross, and it was trading 0.3% higher ahead of the US session, seen at around 81.00.</p>
<h2>RBA sounds somewhat dovish</h2>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia left monetary policy unchanged earlier in the day, with <strong>the primary rate kept at 0.1%</strong>
. However, the following statement sounded slightly more dovish than expected, undermining the Australian dollar.</p>
<p><strong>The statement read that the central scenario for a rate rise will not be met before 2024.</strong>
 The central Bank remains committed to maintaining highly supportive monetary conditions.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Bank's business liaison and data on job vacancies suggest that many firms seek to hire workers ahead of the expected reopening in October and November, implying the economy will grow again in the December quarter.</p>
<h2>Overnight negative news for JPY</h2>
<p>In Japan, <strong>the Tokyo CPI index rose to 0.3% year-on-year in September, up from -0.4% previously</strong>
. However, the core inflation index stayed at -0.1%.
From other news, Japan Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Tuesday that Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told him to stick to bold monetary easing and flexible fiscal spending, to put a decisive end to deflation. Furthermore, <strong>he hopes that BOJ will continue efforts to achieve a 2% inflation target</strong>
.</p>
<p>It looks like the money printing and negative interest rates will never end in Japan.</p>
<p>Later in the day, the US services ISM is due and should decrease to 59.9 in September, from 61.7 in August. The employment index is expected to stay unchanged at 53.7, while the prices paid (or inflation subindex) will most likely rise to 79.7 from 75.4 previously, confirming that inflation is not transitory.</p>
<p>As that is one of the more important macro indicators, some volatility could hit the markets after the release.</p>
<h2>AUDJPY defends 50-day average</h2>
<p><strong>The Aussie managed to defend the 50-day moving average, currently at 80.45</strong>
, which could be a strong bullish signal. It is now trying to break out from the recent triangle pattern, facing immediate resistance at 81.15, where the upper triangle line is located.</p>
<p>If successful, the Aussie could jump toward the current swing highs in the 82 region. However, it needs to close above 82 on a daily chart to change the medium-term trend back to bullish.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if sentiment worsens again, the support is at the mentioned 50-day average near 80.45, followed by another demand zone at the psychological level of 80.00.</p>

<Title>NZD plunges despite a rate hike, hawkish guidance</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The NZD/USD pair, also known as the Kiwi, was down 1% Wednesday, dropping despite a relatively hawkish monetary policy meeting earlier in the day. At the time of writing, the pair was trading at 0.6880.</p>
<h2>Hawkish RBNZ fails to help Kiwi</h2>
<p>The <strong>Reserve Bank of New Zealand hiked the Official Cash Rate by 0.25% to 0.5%</strong>
, raising rates for the first time in seven years. Additionally, <strong>it said that further tightening would continue.</strong>
</p>
<p>The following statement further read: Economic activity will recover quickly as alert level restrictions ease. The headline cpi inflation is expected to increase above 4 percent in the near term. Therefore, it is appropriate to continue reducing the level of monetary stimulus.</p>
<p>Despite the rather hawkish wording of further reducing stimulus and more tightening, the Kiwi fell notably, as previously said.</p>

<span class="img-caption">New Zealand Dollar money pack 3d illustration, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<span class="post-quote">We would argue that for central banks more generally, hiking into current global economic conditions is not as currency supportive as hiking when conditions are more favourable. Rate hikes when growth could deteriorate are never greeted with the same enthusiasm, </span>
<span class="quote-author">economists at MUFG Bank informed today.</span>
<p>Additionally, New Zealand covid conditions worsen with a slow rise in virus infections. As a result, the neverending local lockdowns will likely be extended, further hindering economic growth, but boosting inflation.</p>
<p>From other news, <strong>the US ADP employment report for September was released and increased to 568,000, up from 374,000 previously.</strong>
 Analysts had expected 428,000, so it was a huge upside surprise. <strong>That was the biggest increase since June</strong>
</p>
<p>The numbers come ahead of Friday’s monthly non-farm payrolls (NFP) report from the Labor Department, which is currently forecast to show the US added 450,000 jobs in September.</p>
<p>The Kiwi is now testing the short-term uptrend line, which is currently near 0.6870. If the pair drops below it, we could see a quick decline toward the actual cycle lows at 0.68. A breakdown below that level would confirm the medium-term downtrend, most likely targeting the 0.65 zone.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the resistance seems to be at this week’s highs at around 0.6980, followed by the psychological level and the 50-day moving average at 0.70. Thus, the short-term outlook appears neutral and unclear, while the medium-term trend seems bearish, but it needs to be confirmed by new lows.</p>

<Title>EUR/JPY struggles to find direction</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The EUR/JPY cross quickly erased last week's gains and dropped below some basic technical levels as it can't sustain any momentum and struggles to find a direction.</p>
<h2>Japanese events</h2>
<p>The Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda spoke again on Thursday, <strong>saying that the country's consumer inflation is expected to turn positive.</strong>
</p>
<p>He also reiterated that <strong>the central bank wouldn't hesitate to ease policy further if necessary</strong>
 (is it even possible?). Furthermore, he thinks that Japan's economy is expected to recover as the coronavirus pandemic's impact gradually subsides. According to Kuroda, Japan's financial system remains stable, and financial conditions are accommodative overall.</p>
<p>Japanese macro data came out disappointing today, with the <strong>leading indicator index dropping to 101.8 in August, down from 104.1</strong>
 previously, while the <strong>coincident index also weakened, from 94.4 to 91.5.</strong>
</p>
<h2>European data & speeches</h2>
<p>The European calendar brought German industrial production today. <strong>The monthly change crashed massively to -4%, down from 1.3% previously</strong>
. The year-on-year gauge dropped from 6% to 1.7%, against expectations of an improvement to 11.4%. Nevertheless, the euro remained higher after these weak numbers.</p>
<p>From other news, the European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council member and Bank of France Head Francois Villeroy de Galhau said that he believes inflation will come back down below 2% within a year. That was a somewhat optimistic view, considering the inflation pressures are not easing but still building up.</p>
<p>Later in the day, the ECB monetary policy account minutes will be released. It's a detailed record of the ECB Governing Board's most recent meeting, providing in-depth insights into the economic conditions that influenced their decision on where to set interest rates.</p>
<p>Additionally, the ECB's Elderson, Lane, and Schnabel are scheduled to speak today, possibly influencing the euro, although their speeches rarely cause major market movements.</p>
<h2>Short and medium-term chop</h2>
<p><strong>The cross failed to stay above the psychological 130 threshold,</strong>
 and it also declined back below its 50-day moving average. The medium-term trend remains neutral as the euro has not moved anywhere since July. The short-term outlook also seems relatively neutral as rallies are sold quickly, but dips are being bought. Thus, no new lows or highs are being made. As a result, choppy trading is expected to continue.</p>
<p>The resistance could be found near 129.50 (at the 50-day moving average), followed by the last week's highs at 130.50. The EUR/JPY cross needs to jump above 130.70 to change the short-term trend to bullish.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the support is seen at 128.50, with <strong>the critical demand zone at 128.00. If the euro drops below 128, the medium and short-term outlooks will most likely change to bearish.</strong>

<Title>How are Facebook stocks holding up after a 6-hour outage?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>The fall has happened earlier</h2>
<p>The vast majority of people notice that there is something wrong with stocks only right after such news is announced on the market. However, anyone who looks at the chart properly will notice that Facebook had its peak on <strong>1.9.2021</strong>
. Until then, it went into correction. The key date here, however, is <strong>17.09.21</strong>
. That is because on that day Facebook fell through the trend. Therefore, the outage has only deepened the stock market crash.</p>
<p>From this, we can deduce that the collapse of Facebook's stocks occurred before the outage itself. And so the outage of Facebook was just fuel, which was poured into the metaphorical fire. As the first support, where the whole slump could stop, I would see the level of <strong>395 - 304 USD</strong>
 per share. We are currently at <strong>$ 333</strong>
. Overall, this is a <strong>-15%</strong>
 decrease from the top, which is good, but definitely not good enough.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Facebook stock price on a daily chart</span>
<h2>The overall trend</h2>
<p>As for the overall trend, Facebook looks similar to the S&P500 or NASDAQ indices. Where we have seen rapid growth in recent months. The price is currently testing this basic trend on a weekly chart. It is therefore logical that a reaction occurred in these places. I think a rebound might come here, but it will be rather short-lived than long-lasting. As with the indices, I expect the price to drop through the trend.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Facebook stock price on a weekly chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The analysis clearly shows that Facebook's stock price began to fall long before the recent outage. Overall, we now see declines and uncertainties in the stock world. Prices have been rising for a long time and a deeper correction hangs in the air, threatening stocks and indices.</p>

<Excerpt>Probably the most impactful news this week is outage of Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp. These services were unavailable for almost 6 hours. How has it affected Facebook's stocks?</Excerpt>

<Title>EUR/USD holds minor gains after Non-Farm Payrolls</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The EUR/USD pair showed only a slight desire to move after the latest macro data, trading 0.1% higher during the US session. The greenback's initial decline after the data was short-lived, and traders quickly bought the dip.</p>
<h2>US job market update for September</h2>
<p>Earlier today, the Bureau of Labor Statistics informed that with expectations of a 500,000 print and whisper numbers sharply higher, in September, <strong>the US added only 194,000 jobs, down by nearly half from the upward revised 366K in August</strong>
, and the lowest print of 2021. The USD dropped broadly after this weak number.</p>
<p>Moreover, both prior months were revised higher. The change in employment for July was revised up by 38,000, from +1,053,000 to +1,091,000. The August' change was revised up by 131,000, from +235,000 to +366,000.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>the unemployment rate improved notably to 4.8%, from 5.2%</strong>
, and below the 5.1% expectation as the number of unemployed workers dropped by 710,000 from 8.384 million to 7.674 million.</p>
<p>Lastly, the <strong>average hourly earnings rose again, improving from 0.4% to 0.6% month-on-month</strong>
, beating the consensus of 0.4%. On a yearly basis, hourly earnings rose 4.6%, in line with expectations.</p>
<p>It was a somewhat mixed report, with the headline non-farm payrolls dropping and hugely missing expectations, but other parts of the report were actually better than expected. Therefore, the decline in the USD seems to be limited, and it is slowly erasing the initial reaction's drop.</p>
<p>From other news, Christine Lagarde, President of the Europen Central Bank (ECB), said on Friday that they need to manage the exit from the pandemic very carefully. However, market participants already know that central banks won't rush to exit from their money-printing programs. Therefore, her remarks failed to spur any (downside) volatility in the EUR/USD pair.</p>
<p>There is nothing new on the daily chart – the euro keeps sliding toward the critical support of 1.15. Still, it looks like the bearish momentum wanes slowly, implying a possible bullish bounce soon, especially if traders re-interpret today's data as bearish for the USD.</p>

<Excerpt>Latest US labor market data failed to spur any significant volatility in the USD, the medium-term downtrend for the pair remains intact.</Excerpt>

<Title>Bitcoin has broken through key levels. This is a great chance for the bull market to continue</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Main chart</h2>
<p>For about 2-3 weeks, I have been starting off my day with basically the identical chart. Same levels were marked, same ideas followed. But this week a change has come as Bitcoin overcame the declining trend and also created a higher high. And what is even better, Bitcoin managed to stay above these levels even.</p>
<p>In the current situation, it would be best if the price would stay below the <strong>$ 52,760</strong>
 level on a 1D chart (ie not falling below the last high). This would be the best possible scenario for us. However, adhering to the declining trendline would be enough. That is because unless the price goes under the trendline, every move can be perceived as bullish, and every price decrease as a mere correction.</p>
<p>When we look at Bitcoin, we can notice a beautiful growing channel. The price creates higher lows and higher highs. All this points us to the conclusion that Bitcoin looks very bullish.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/Bitcoin_8_10_9fed405ad5.png" alt="Bitcoin on a daily chart">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Bitcoin on a 1D chart</span>
<h2>What must not happen?</h2>
<p>To give me an idea and a conclusion. As I see it, we are still in the bull market and there is a high probability that a new ATH will come this year, hopefully reaching 100K. On-chain data, technical and fundamental analysis looks very promising too. Bitcoin is “on the roll”. But what can go wrong?</p>
<p>There is one factor that comes to my mind that could reverse the current situation. For Bitcoin to grow, there must not be panic or fear on classic markets (stocks, indices). Let the previous 3 weeks serve as an example as Bitcoin has had 3 very strong bearish fundamentals during that time and its price fell accordingly. But, and this is interesting, as soon as no negative fundamentals appeared in the last 7 days, Bitcoin grew.</p>
<p>If this bull market is to continue and Bitcoin is to go to a new maximum, then we need the classic markets to be stabilized. Unfortunately, every fear and panic sale will also affect Bitcoin and may consequently slow it down. However, if the classic markets manage to keep it nice and calm for at least another 2-3 months, then Bitcoin can easily reach <strong>100,000 USD</strong>
.</p>

<Excerpt>This week can easily be described as a key one in terms of further Bitcoin development. The number one cryptocurrency overcame several important levels and, more importantly, managed to stay above them.</Excerpt>

<Title>XPT/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.03%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.08%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.53%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.51%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>4.78%</strong>
, more than the third standard deviation. It was a very positive day for the bulls. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>1</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>

. Indexation is currently in a growing phase of the cycle. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. In the case of longer-term MAs, <strong>XPT/USD</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment. However, the monthly MA again supports bulls.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, we have witnessed higher downward trends, even though the price is higher. They did not exceed <strong>4</strong>
 days. The total maximum in the measured period (last 3 years) is <strong>7</strong>
 days. Upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>one</strong>
 day in the same period. The total maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>6</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.27%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>4.29%</strong>
, well above average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-2.40%</strong>
 and <strong>2.40%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>3.60%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this year, the basic technical analysis has supported bearish sentiment as the price of the commodity creates lower lows and lower highs. However, a recent rebound from an important area may have finally motivated the bulls. Yesterday, <strong>XPT/USD</strong>
 bounced off the demand zone (green rectangle), where are the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50.00%</strong>
 and the psychological level of <strong>1 000.00</strong>
. In addition, it climbed above the short-term moving average. The bullish scenario also supported the divergence between price development and the RSI created since June. However, we can see the creation of the opposite divergence, which could be helped by the resistance created by the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>38.20%</strong>
.</p>

<Title>Lords of the markets: Jesse Livermore</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[ is here and today you will be introduced to one of the most important traders of all time.</p>
<p>We have already talked about several important people of the financial markets. We have mentioned <a href="https://investro.com/investro-academy/lords-of-the-markets-jim-simons">Jim Simons</a>
, Alexander Elder or probably the best-known investor of all time, Warren Buffett. But we have not yet mentioned a person, who is considered to be the best trader. That person is Jesse Livermore, who will be introduced in this article.</p>
<h2>10 points you need to know about Livermore</h2>
<p>Jesse Livermore was born in 1877 and started trading as soon as he was 14. He was a self-taught trader who learnt most of his life lessons the hard way.</p>
<p>At the peak of his career (around the year 1929) he was worth around 100 million dollars. In today´s world this would be between 1.5 and 14 billion dollars depending on the measuring techniques.</p>
<p>Jesse Livermore was able to do this by solely trading and managing his own money and funds.</p>
<p>Jesse Livermore was one of the traders to ever have a clear trading plan. Many of his trading rules are still applicable today and are key for many trading systems.</p>
<p>Most of these rules are fairly simple such as:</p>
<p>Trade with a stop, which you know before you enter to the position.</p>
<p>Do not follow too many stocks.</p>
<p>Let your profits run and close your losing trades.</p>
<p>Jesse Livermore was not only able to get extremely rich, but also lose all of his wealth. He himself said that losing his wealth was mostly due to his mistakes and him not following his trading plans. By this claim he only highlighted the need for following of the strategy that the trader chooses.</p>
<p>The shift was not only visible with his fortune, but also in his trading path. Jesse Livermore started as a day trader, however he then switched to swing trading, so that he could later continue as a long-term trader.</p>
<p>Jesse Livermore traded mostly stocks. His rules were to trade mostly trending stocks and the biggest stocks in any given industry.</p>
<p>His incredibly interesting story brought attention of publishers and writers. For instance, Edvin Lefevre wrote a biography about Jesse Livermore in 1923 called “<em>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator,</em>
” which is highly recommended book by many market experts. Livermore himself wrote a book in 1940 (which is also a year he died) called “<em>How to Trade in Stocks.</em>
”</p>
<p>By the end of his life, Livermore has not only lost his entire wealth (yet again), but he was also forced to live off his family.</p>
<h2>3 quotes of Livermore</h2>
<p>The fact that Livermore was extremely smart is also proven by his quotes, which are often cited between traders or investors. Here are just few of the most interesting ones.</p>
<p><em>"There is nothing new in Wall Street. There cannot be, because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again.”</em>
</p>
<p><em>“The point is not so much to buy as cheap as possible or go short at top price, but to buy or sell at the right time.”</em>
</p>
<p><em>“There are times when money can be made investing and speculating in stocks, but money cannot consistently be made trading every day or every week during the year. Only the foolhardy will try it. It just is not in the cards and cannot be done.”</em>
</p>

<Title>USD/JPY at three-year highs after US jobs market data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The greenback managed to score some impressive gains against the yen, supported by rising US yields and dovish official comments from Japan. On Monday, it was trading at around 113, the level last seen in December 2018.</p>
<h2>Labor market data helped USD/JPY</h2>
<p>On Friday, <strong>US yields surged notably, pushing the 10-year yield above the 1.6% threshold for the first time since early June.</strong>
 Hand-in-hand went the USDJPY pair, and it soared toward 113, reaching levels last seen in December 2018.</p>
<p>Traders paid attention to the latest US labor market update. <strong>The jobs report was the lowest this year, with only 194,000 nonfarm jobs (nonfarm payrolls) added last month</strong>
, well below the official consensus. On the other hand, the unemployment rate improved further, along with wage growth, sending US yields and the USD/JPY pair above some key technical levels.</p>
<h2>Big banks are bullish</h2>
<p>Economists at Credit Suisse expect the pair to trend higher for the 2018 highs at 114.26/55 initially and then 117.20, the long-term downtrend from April 1990.
Economists at Rabobank expect the pair to pounce the 113.70 December 2018 peak on an erosion of the 113.00 psychological level.</p>
<p>Société Générale analysts said that USD/JPY has now crossed above the peak of 2020 at 112.23/112.00, highlighting the persistence of upward momentum. The following potential objectives are located at 113.10 and projections of 113.40/113.90.</p>
<p>Lastly, Karen Jones, Team Head FICC Technical Analysis Research at Commerzbank, reported that USD/JPY had overcome the important 112.23/50 zone, representing highs since 2019. The break above here introduces scope to 114.55, the October 2018 high.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Japanese <strong>Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he is keen to compile an economic package as early as the next month</strong>
.</p>
<span class="post-quote">Achieving solid economic growth is most important, which we will do via bold monetary policy, flexible fiscal policy, and growth strategy,</span>
<span class="quote-author">Kishida continued.</span>
<p>His comments undermined the JPY further as it looks like Japan will have the loosest fiscal and monetary policy among the G10 nations.</p>
<p>On the downside, the <strong>greenback should remain above previous highs in the 111 region to confirm all these bullish calls</strong>
. Conversely, a decline below 111 could lead to another leg lower, targeting the 50-day moving average at 110.30, or the psychological zone of 110, where the pair had spent a considerable time over the previous months.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Momentum remains bullish and dips are expected to be bought as long as the greenback trades above the 111 level.</Excerpt>

<Title>FTSE ticks higher after UK jobs data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The FTSE index, along with other world indices, erased today's losses, and it was trading somewhat higher ahead of the US session, climbing again above the 50-day average. At the time of writing, it was seen trading at around 7,120 GBP.</p>
<h2>UK data support British stocks</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, the UK Office for National Statistics informed that job vacancies hit a 20-year high between July and September. They rose by 318,000, from pre-pandemic January to March 2020 levels, to 1.1 million, with accommodation and food services seeing a near-50,000 jump.</p>
<p>Additionally, the unemployment rate improved slightly to 4.5% in the three months to August from 4.6% in the three months to July.</p>
<p>Data also showed that <strong>claimant count change rose slightly to -51,100 in September, up from -58,600 previously</strong>
. Lastly, <strong>wage growth remained relatively strong, well above 5%, reflecting inflation in other parts of the economy.</strong>
</p>
<p>It looks like the labor market in the UK has recovered quickly from the post lockdown lows, and the number of employees on payroll in September is now exceeding pre-pandemic levels.
More UK data will be released tomorrow, including industrial production, manufacturing production, and the Gross Domestic Product for August, expected to improve notably to 0.5% from 0.1% month-on-month.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, sentiment in the stock markets seems a bit bearish as indices have dropped notably from their all-time highs amid fears of high inflation and monetary policy tightening.</p>
<span class="post-quote">While investors want to believe the narrative that stock markets can continue to move higher, this belief is bumping up against the reality of how the continued rise in energy prices, as well as supply-chain pressures, are likely to impact company profit margins,</span>
<span class="quote-author">said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in London.</span>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/fste_100_index_39f84869de.jpg" alt="ftse 100 equity index">
<h2>Nothing new on the daily chart</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, it is still a bit boring here. Since April, the index has not moved anywhere, and the 50-day moving average has been moving sideways for a long time, losing its relevance.</p>
<p><strong>The key resistance of the current consolidation zone seems to be at around 7,200 GBP</strong>
, which is not that far away. However, the medium-term uptrend could be confirmed if the index rises above that level, targeting 7,500 GBP in the initial push higher.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <strong>the first meaningful support zone seems to be near the psychological level of 7,000 GBP</strong>
, followed by the lows of the recent crashes near 6,800 GBP. Bulls must defend those two zones or risk a more significant correction.</p>
<p>Until we see a clear break from the recent consolidation zone, swing traders will most likely remain out of the market, leaving it to short-term traders and speculators.</p>

<Title>Silver soars 2% despite rising inflation & rate hike expectations</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Silver and gold climbed on Wednesday, capitalizing on weaker USD. Metals ignored rising rate-hike expectations and staged an impressive rally.</p>
<h2>Inflation will not be transitory</h2>
<p>Earlier today, <strong>the headline CPI came out hotter than expected - +0.4% month-on-month versus +0.3% expected), with the yearly change edging higher +5.4%.</strong>
 That is equal to its highest since July 2008. Moreover, inflation is showing no signs of weakening, undermining the whole "transitory" mantra.</p>
<p><strong>The core inflation ticked higher to 0.2% MoM (versus +0.1% expected), leaving YoY flat around +4.0%.</strong>
</p>
<p>Both gold and silver fell notably after the release, but the dip was quickly bought, and silver rose to new daily highs, pushing above 23 USD and rising more than 2% on the day.</p>
<p>The last few days have seen short-term rate expectations jump higher and today's hotter than expected headline CPI pushed them one step further. <strong>As a result, market participants now see a 90% chance of a rate hike by September 2022.</strong>
</p>
<p>However, that is still one year away! Considering that inflation continues to rise rapidly, the Fed should start tapering immediately and begin raising rates as soon as possible.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic noted that belief in the 'transitory' inflation pressures – something that has guided Fed policy for the last 12 months - may be fading at the central bank. However, it is unlikely that the FOMC committee will be more hawkish than previously expected.</p>
<p>Later in the day, the FOMC minutes from September's Fed meeting will be released, possibly causing more market volatility.</p>
<p>From other news, the IMF downgraded its global growth forecast and now expects world GDP to rise 5.9% this year, down 0.1% from what it anticipated in July, citing rising inflation and supply-chain disruptions.</p>
<span class="img-caption">Central banks will need to provide clear guidance about their future approach to monetary policy, aiming to avoid an unwarranted or abrupt tightening of financial conditions. Monetary authorities should remain vigilant, and if price pressures turn out to be more persistent than anticipated, act decisively to avoid an unmooring of inflation expectations,</span>
<span class="post-quote">the fund said in its statement.</span>
<p>The next resistance for silver is at 23.35 USD, where the 50-day moving average is seen. The last time, in September, it sent silver to new lows. But it looks like a relief rally could be upon us since silver is rising on otherwise bearish news.</p>
<p>In case of a bullish breakout, the following target will likely be at 23.90 USD, with a possible rally toward the 24.80 USD zone. <strong>There is a nice bullish divergence between the MACD indicator and the price, supporting the bullish thesis for now.</strong>
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the support is in the 22.50 USD range, and silver needs to stay above it for the short-term outlook to remain bullish.</p>

<Title>Do you know how to distinguish a quality project from a possible scam?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The cryptocurrency market has been practically a space since its inception, which various scammers have used to their advantage. Their primary tactic is to misuse users' poor awareness and to entice them to be fabulously rich. They focus in particular on new and inexperienced investors and traders who are <strong>unable to distinguish whether it is a relevant project or a scam.</strong>
 We have encountered a number of similar scams, and some even operate to this day.</p>
<p>Is there a guaranteed way to detect these unfair practices and thus avoid unnecessary problems or loss of funds? It's not as easy as it might seem. There is certainly no flawless scam detection tool, and <strong>some projects may not be scams and are only poorly managed.</strong>
 However, we can look at common features (red flags), which inform you quite reliably about the condition of the project and whether it could be a scam.</p>
<h2>Market activity</h2>
<p>Scammers often abuse the fact that <strong>creating your own cryptocurrency is literally a matter of hours.</strong>
 They simply create a cryptocurrency, come up with a (often fictitious) project around it, and go sale. Fortunately, we can find out relatively quickly whether there is real interest in cryptocurrency. Just look at the activity associated with its trading in the market.</p>
<p>Therefore, as one of the first things, <strong>you should look at where the cryptocurrency is traded.</strong>
 If they are only decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Uniswap and PancakeSwap, we can consider it a red flag. Due to their decentralized nature, there are essentially no requirements for listing a cryptocurrency on such an exchange. Decentralized exchanges do not have sophisticated ways of verifying projects and it can be said that they rely on the market itself to make the best decisions as a result.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Market activity checking, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>Some new projects start with the fact that their cryptocurrency is traded first on DEX and then, after gaining some relevance, they are also listed on reputable centralized exchanges (CEX). However, even the fact that a cryptocurrency is traded on a large centralized exchange does not 100% guarantee that you cannot get burned on it. A good example is a cryptocurrency SHIBA INU, which is listed on the Coinbase and Binance exchanges, despite the fact that the project has not yet presented anything valuable. Exchanges are companies whose main goal is, of course, to make a profit, and if they see the potential of large trading volumes, they are probably willing to lower their demands on the quality of the project. It is equally important to monitor whether the cryptocurrency is listed on a "quality exchange" (FTX, Binance, Coinbase) or on an exchange that is known for a weaker level of project screening (HitBTC, Latoken).</p>
<p><strong>Another metric we should definitely note is the volumes of cryptocurrency trades.</strong>
 Low trading volumes are a very bad sign of virtually any cryptocurrency. If these project volumes have dropped significantly over time, it usually means that interest from investors and traders is declining, and there is certainly a reason for this. At the same time, of course, it reduces the level of liquidity of a given cryptocurrency, and it can be much more difficult for investors to buy or sell.</p>
<p>We certainly do not claim that projects and cryptocurrencies that are not listed on any exchange or are currently only traded on decentralized platforms must be fraudulent. Every project started somewhere and a similar investment in the early stages can bring an interesting value to the investor when made the right choice. However, it is a <strong>much riskier investment and as such the investor should approach it.</strong>
</p>
<h2>Tokenomics</h2>
<p>An important thing to look at when examining a project is the market <strong>capitalization of cryptocurrency.</strong>
 It is the outcome of the total offer in circulation and the current price of the asset. It is according to this metric that cryptocurrencies are also listed on known crypto-analytical portals (for example, CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko). Market capitalization can show you whether a cryptocurrency is within the range that indicates further potential growth or can be considered overestimated. A sign of overvaluation can be, for example, a market ceiling that far exceeds all similar projects. On the other hand, projects with lower market capitalization combined with high trading volumes may seem to be the right choice. However, a number of other factors need to be considered.</p>
<p>Most cryptocurrencies have a <strong>pre-defined and fixed maximum quantity, which means that new ones can be created/mined until this number is reached.</strong>
 For example, on Bitcoin, it is 21 million units and we know with the certainty guaranteed by its code that there will never be more. This finite number gives Bitcoin a level of a rarity - limited supply is pushing up prices. The second-largest cryptocurrency, Ether works differently and has no finite number of units. However, Ethereum has implemented <strong>mechanisms in its ecosystem that ensure the regular burning</strong>
 of ETH, and these should ensure a gradual reduction in the level of inflation (until deflation in the future). Thus, cryptocurrencies with an unlimited supply do not have to be downright bad if they have the correct tools set up. It is important for the investor that the market is not overwhelmed by a new offer, which has a negative impact on the price.</p>
<p>One of the key factors is the amount of cryptocurrency in circulation. Many projects have this metric at low levels, and this may mean that the market is constantly flooded with new supply, which is pushing down prices. The pace at which this number is increasing every year is symbolic inflation of supply. <strong>Higher supply inflation could lead to the slower price growth</strong>
 as supply quickly "dilutes".</p>
<p>A large number of projects have their <strong>private investors, who supported them in the initial stages in exchange for cheaper tokens.</strong>
 They often have their tokens locked for a certain period during which they cannot freely dispose of them (sell). As an investor, you should definitely focus on obtaining information on the future unlocking of these volumes, as this is another factor that increases supply and may slower price growth. If the token unlock curve were too steep, it could cause a supply shock and the price could fall quite sharply. This happens especially in a situation where private investors have very large profits, which push them to sell and they can see the project only as a quick way to get rich.</p>
<h2>Token distribution</h2>
<p>In general, if most of the volume of cryptocurrency is held by the company that issued it or its team, we consider it a big red flag. The question is - why do they need such large amounts of their own cryptocurrencies? Of course, <strong>holding a certain percentage is normal and the company is motivated to meet the set goals,</strong>
 as they can then use them according to their own budget needs. However, if they own a large part of the total offer from the beginning, they can do so with the intention of selling, notwithstanding the sharp drop in price (Pump and Dump).</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/circle_chart_crypto_tokenomics_328fcef069.jpg" alt="Circle chart - Crypto tokenomics">
<span class="img-caption">Circle chart - Crypto tokenomics, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>If possible, always <strong>check the distribution of tokens directly on the blockchain</strong>
 and not only on the official project website. If you discover discrepancies between what they have on the web and the data on the blockchain (this is not uncommon), increase caution. Blockchain never lies, and you can find this data through the services of various blockchain explorers (for example, for Ether tokens, it's Etherscan). You can look at the wallets of all the owners of a given cryptocurrency, identify investors and the team, see if they are selling and if they have their cryptocurrencies locked in time. If the team can sell large volumes immediately, this is another red flag.</p>
<p>One of the popular trends this year is the charging of a "tax" on the sale of cryptocurrencies. Thus, if a user sells a cryptocurrency, a fee of, for example, 10% is deducted, which is then (proportionally by volume) distributed among the remaining holders. Similar practices are a big exclamation point, as <strong>relevant projects do not need such ridiculous mechanisms that stimulate users to hold cryptocurrencies.</strong>
</p>
<h2>Memecoins and similar "cheap" cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>New retail investors are often deceived into believing that low-cost cryptocurrencies (such as $ 0.0000001) are undervalued and represent a great opportunity to make a quick profit. However, this is far from true and it is necessary to realize that the market capitalization also has the total number of pieces in circulation in the equation. By issuing a cryptocurrency with a huge supply (often in billions of pieces), one can get its price to a level that gives the inexperienced investor the impression of a huge potential appreciation.</p>
<p>This technique is also used by popular memecoins (such as SHIBA INU and SAFEMOON), which issued literally trillions of pieces at an extremely low price. Uninformed retail investors then think that they will buy a large number of tokens for $ 10, and if its price hits $ 1, for example, they will immediately be millionaires. Beware spoiler - it won't happen! These are mostly the same investors who claim that Bitcoin is already "too expensive" solely due to the fact that they buy only a fraction of Bitcoin for $ 10. We <strong>always compare projects on the basis of market capitalization and not on the basis of the cryptocurrency price.</strong>
</p>
<h2>A team</h2>
<p>This is one of the key factors in the future success of the cryptocurrency project. These people are <strong>responsible for fulfilling the company's obligations</strong>
 and it can be assumed that they will not want to ruin their good reputation. Crypto projects often publish information about team members directly on their website, and some also offer links to their professional channels (such as LinkedIn), where you can learn about <strong>what they have done in the past and what they can do.</strong>
 It often happens that this information is variously embellished, or even completely untrue, which of course again represents the red flag.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/people_joining_for_cooperation_success_business_cb9956287b.jpg" alt="People joining for cooperation success business">
<span class="img-caption">People joining for cooperation success business, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>It is no exception that team members were in some cases directly responsible for hacking the platform and stealing funds (so-called <strong>"inside job"</strong>
). The project with anonymous team members and developers can thus raise doubts, as they will not face any criticism and public pressure in the event of a problem. On the contrary, if <strong>well-known personalities stand in favour of the project</strong>
 (we are not talking about influencers, but, for example, personalities from IT and the crypto environment), it is certainly a good sign. Of course, there are also many anonymous development teams behind quality projects - the best example is Satoshi Nakamoto, who has also decided to stay anonymous.</p>
<p>Among other things, you can monitor <strong>other activities of team members, especially in the online space.</strong>
 Their behaviour can signal whether they are professionals who are serious or more interested in, for example, a short-term view of the price of their cryptocurrency. You can also analyze their communication - do they not communicate at all, do they behave unprofessionally, speculate about the price of the token? This can be a bad sign. However, if they are communicative, try to help, answer questions, are patient with new members, and try to educate, for example, you may be a little calmer.</p>
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<p>The roadmap is a <strong>simplified project development plan that is transferred to the timeline.</strong>
 It is often visible on the crypto project website or is <strong>part of a whitepaper.</strong>
 When evaluating the roadmap of the project, several things need to be taken into account. The first step is to verify that they have been able to perform the tasks they have set up properly and on time in the past. If not, you need to try to find out why and exceptionally you don't have to be too strict. Some teams may be too optimistic at the beginning of the project about the timing of certain steps, and these may simply require a little more time. While this speaks to their ability to estimate the complexity of processes, it does not necessarily mean that it must be a scam. It is especially important that they actually deliver the planned things, and if they do it on time, it is of course even better.</p>
<p>Transparency is very important in this regard. Some projects regularly <strong>publish their codes in public repositories, such as Github</strong>
 (which is only possible with certain types of projects). However, if the project did not meet several milestones without explaining it relevantly, it is likely to be repeated in future development.</p>
<p>It is also important to monitor what types of plans the project has. For example, if the only project plan for a given quarter is listing on the exchange, it may mean that the team has no value-oriented plans and simply wants the community to buy their cryptocurrency in anticipation of listing on a centralized exchange, which can increase the cost. Similar goals show that the project is more interested in exposure (visibility) and not in building a useful and valuable product.</p>
<p>Among the types of targets, we should look for protocol innovations with added functionality, scalability improvements, or other blockchain and protocol integrations. The objectives of the individual projects are, of course, very specific and certainly different, but they must be aimed at improving the final product. <strong>Goals and plans like "We get a retweet from Elon Musk" show the team's thinking</strong>
 and do not look good.</p>
<h2>Partnerships</h2>
<p>Interesting and successful projects usually have <strong>partnerships with other well-known companies and can be a good sign.</strong>
 However, we often observe that scammers abuse this fact and publish fictitious information about partnerships on their websites. If the project states that they are collaborating with Ethereum or Binance, it may mean that they have actually just created their cryptocurrency on the Ethereum blockchain, or Binance Smart Chain. You should therefore be extremely <strong>careful about similar "empty" partnerships</strong>
 (which the other party often does not even need to know about) and you should make your own research into the real terms of the partnership.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/partnership_security_concept_aec5aab006.jpg" alt="Partnership security concept">
<span class="img-caption">Partnership security concept, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>A separate category is various <strong>awards from conferences and summits.</strong>
 The fact that a project has received an award does not necessarily indicate its relevance. Some of these events also go exclusively for profit, and <strong>to get an award you just need to become their partner</strong>
 (read; just financially contribute). Does that sound unbelievable? We can safely acknowledge and say that some even send e-mails to hundreds (maybe thousands) of crypto companies as part of their campaigns and offer them prepaid award winnings. In extreme cases, you can also come up with the name of the category and the award that you will win under their heading. <strong>Relevant projects are not interested in various fake awards, but only in the quality of their final product,</strong>
 which will then be appreciated by its users. Scammers will talk about such "successes" literally everywhere because that's all they have.</p>
<h2>Extremely high yields</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, <strong>greed is one of the strongest motivations for investors.</strong>
 This is one of the reasons why its abuse has probably become the most widely used technique by fraudsters. Just remember one thing here - <strong>if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.</strong>
 This category also includes all Ponzi schemes in which new entrants are made for the rewards of those above them and in particular for the founders' rewards.</p>
<p>These practices are gradually becoming more and more camouflaged, and we have recently seen their huge occurrence, especially in the DeFi industry. **Various protocols here promise huge values of APY **(annual appreciation), which, however, they try to maintain only on the basis of hyperinflation, as the market is constantly flooded with new tokens. Of course, similar systems are not sustainable in the long run, and sooner or later someone will pay for it. It is therefore more like a casino game. Fortunately, protocols that play similar dishonest games with users are relatively easy to identify. These are often absolute copies of relevant platforms (eg Pancakeswap) and the only thing that changes is the token of the given platform and the fact that APY is not fixed and change every day, for example.</p>
<h2>Codes and audits</h2>
<p>Most applications for cryptocurrencies are written in a code (smart contract), which is then executed on a blockchain. Developers can choose whether they want to be <strong>open-source or closed-source.</strong>
 The advantage of open-source software is that anyone can see and verify the code and even propose changes to eliminate "backdoors" and other exploitable bugs. <strong>Open-source is more secure</strong>
 because bugs and vulnerabilities are visible to everyone and can be addressed. Most open-source projects update it on the Github website. Another advantage is that you can look at the activity of the developers of the project.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/code_development_concept_876e515ccb.jpg" alt="Code development concept">
<span class="img-caption">Code development concept, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>Some developers choose not to let the public into their code and it may not be something that should be perceived negatively. For certain types of code, it is even a necessity that protects the company, for example, from copying the code or providing hackers with a more comprehensive view of the structure of the platform.</p>
<p>An interesting and important part of the development of crypto applications and platforms is a <strong>comprehensive code analysis by a third party, the so-called audit.</strong>
 It should be performed by a reputable and independent organization. This is a good substitution for projects where it is not possible to publish the code for various reasons (described above). In particular, projects which operate with large amounts of funds and user data - such as <strong>DeFi loan platforms or exchange platforms - should be audited.</strong>
 An audit from a reputable company can provide investors and users with the necessary level of confidence, but it must be said that even the audited code may not be perfect. First of all, it shows the team's willingness to provide its users with secure services. The absence of an audit may be a signal that the code is not secure.</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>A strong community can significantly help the project gain popularity, even if their cryptocurrency has no relevant use. <strong>Many suspicious (to put it mildly) projects try to create the illusion of a strong community</strong>
 and attract new buyers. Anyone can buy followers on social networks and "likes". On social networks, however, you can relatively easily distinguish whether it is a real involvement of real users or a purchased activity. For example, a page on Twitter with thousands of followers, which has only a few responses to posts, is very suspicious.</p>
<p>You can relatively easily verify the operation of the project yourself. Try writing them on one of the social networks and asking for help or advice. You will see if they are willing to help with the solution or if the community will be involved in the communication. If the channel is constantly memorized and no one is moderating it, this is usually not a good sign. The type of people in the community and the way they communicate will also tell you a lot about the project. <strong>If speculation about the price of cryptocurrency prevails as a topic of conversation - red flag.</strong>
 Members of the community of strong projects tend to really care about how the product itself succeeds and not just discuss prices.</p>
<h2>Conclusion...</h2>
<p>Today, we've looked at some of the issues you should look out for when researching a cryptocurrency project. <strong>These "red flags" do not necessarily mean that it is a scam</strong>
 or that the project will not be successful. Rather, it is a warning signal that should stimulate you to further in-depth research. The more similar signals you find, the more cautious you should be. Even the fact that a close friend or family member recommends something to you in good faith does not mean anything. <strong>Even known scams worked for some time so that users enjoyed profits.</strong>
</p>
<p>The increased number of scams should encourage every investor to carry out extensive research. Feel free to go through this article with each new project and then evaluate it. Be sure not to underestimate your own research and try to verify everything that is said about the project from all sides.</p>
<p>There are a number of promising projects in the cryptocurrency market. Choosing the right one will save you a lot of trouble and money, which you can then invest in those that have been surveyed.</p>

<Title>USD/CHF loses 50-day average amid broad USD weakness</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The greenback has been suffering since yesterday’s US inflation data, which showed that inflation is in no way peaking. The yearly change remained above the 5% threshold, while the core CPI stayed at 4.0%. <strong>Both numbers are way above the Fed’s 2% inflation target.</strong>
</p>
<p>As a result, <strong>the market expects the Fed to raise rates by September 2022 and continue hiking the fed funds in 2023</strong>
. The QE should end in July 2022, according to the official market forecasts.</p>
<h2>Fed remains hawkish</h2>
<p>Later today, <strong>three FOMC members are scheduled to speak - Bostic, Barkin, and Williams</strong>
. Investors will likely pay attention to their words as they can provide clues whether the central bank is indeed ready to start tapering its bond purchases this year.</p>
<p>Additionally, it seems that the Fed officials do not appear swayed from their QE tapering plans by the slowdown in jobs growth, possibly reinforcing the thesis of monetary policy tightening.</p>
<span class="quote-author">Fed officials continue to signal a strong preference for moving ahead with a relatively brisk 6 to 9 month tapering of asset purchases, likely announced at their next meeting 4th November and starting before the year is out, 
</span>
<span class="post-quote">analysts at Westpac noted Thursday.</span>
<p>Moreover, <strong>US PPI indices will be released during the US session, expected to continue trending higher.</strong>
 The year-on-year change is forecast to climb to 8.7% from 8.3% previously. At the same time, the core indicator should increase to 7.1%, up from 6.7% in August. The usual Thursday’s jobless claims are also on the agenda.</p>
<p>The Swiss calendar brought domestic producer and import prices for September. The monthly change declined notably to 0.2% from 0.7% previously, while the year-on-year gauge ticked higher to 4.5%. However, Swiss data rarely cause some volatility in the USD/CHF pair, and traders ignored the numbers today.</p>
<h2>Downside risks seem limited</h2>
<p><strong>The daily chart remains pretty bullish</strong>
, but the USD/CHF pair has lost its 50-day moving average at 0.92, possibly sending the USD further lower. The key support of the current uptrend wave is at around 0.9155, where the medium-term uptrend line is located.</p>
<p>As long as the greenback trades above it, the medium-term bull market remains intact. Conversely, a decline below it would likely clear many stop-losses of long positions, potentially leading to a further slide toward 0.91.</p>
<p>However, <strong>the daily chart is starting to look like a rising wedge pattern, which is a bearish reversal formation.</strong>
 Furthermore, there is a bearish divergence between the price and the MACD indicator, indicating a possible reversal as well.</p>
<p>The greenback needs to reclaim the 0.9250 level to cancel the immediate bearish threat. Afterward, the next resistance could be in the 0.93 zone.</p>

<Title>Evergrande and inflation are scaring the markets</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Before we move on to the chart analysis, I would like to comment on two things. <strong>The first one</strong>
 being inflation, which has risen by more than 5% year on year. Such numbers are reported by the USA but also, for example, by the Slovak Republic. Price increase and potential bubbles can be now witnessed almost in every sector with the most notorious being the real estate sector which has been in a bubble for several years now. But other sectors such as commodities (electricity, oil, wood, and natural gas) are growing too. There is a high scarcity of computer chips and stocks and indices are at their record levels too. This is the outcome of a large “money printing” by FED which happened roughly a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>The second</strong>
 thing I want to mention is the Evergrand case. Despite the low media coverage, the problems surrounding this Chinese gigant are worsening. The company is unable to pay interests and difficulties are starting to arise also for other bigger companies. So far, however, this problem has not yet crossed China’s borders. Be that as it may, this can ultimately impact the whole world.</p>
<h2>S&P500</h2>
<p>When we look at this notoriously famous index, we see that it has fallen under the trend, lightly touched the first support, but so far we certainly cannot say that the bull market should continue. The situation is not very positive and problems highly outweigh solutions. As long as the S & P500 is below the trend and until it creates at least a higher minimum and a higher maximum, we can still talk about a correction. No one knows how big this correction will be. The above-mentioned events can play a certain role as well.
Overall, I think that we have interesting times ahead of us and that something big is going to happen soon. For that, we need to be careful.</p>

<Excerpt>The Evergrande case is not being mentioned as frequently in the media as a few weeks ago, however, this does not mean that its impact is over. Quite the contrary. In China, the domino effect is slowly gaining up momentum and other large companies are experiencing their fair share of problems as well.</Excerpt>

<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.62%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.56%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.82%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.77%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was only <strong>-0.77%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>3</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in a positive short-term phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. As we can see in the chart below, medium- and long-term MAs are still in bearish sentiment. However, the monthly MA could be an important support in event of a further decline.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Our estimated Earnings Power Value (EPV) is <strong>349 USD</strong>
 and the Growth Value (GV) is approximately the same. The potential opportunity for growth is based on the value of EPV and % of reinvested earnings. NAV is represented by the Total Stockholders' equity. The following chart uses the value from the last fiscal year.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.15%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.98%</strong>
, which is very close to the average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.50%</strong>
 and <strong>3.50%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>4.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to a declining trend, as the market price has been creating lower lows and lower high since the end of 2020. Therefore, according to our estimate of intrinsic value, the market price is well below the negative (<strong>261 USD</strong>
) scenario. The positive scenario (<strong>492 USD</strong>
) estimates the intrinsic value at new historical highs. The last dynamic rebound, after a decline of almost <strong>60%</strong>
, began in the demand zone (green rectangle). The psychological level <strong>170</strong>
 along with the short-term moving average can also be a very strong technical area.</p>

<Title>SP500 advances above 50-day average & short-term downtrend line</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Thursday brought massive buying to equity markets, pushing the SP500 index 1.5% higher. More importantly, it managed to rise above the recent bearish trend line. At the same time, it also jumped above the 50-day moving average, eliminating the immediate bearish threat from the technical analysis point of view.</p>
<h2>US macro data in focus today</h2>
<p>Later in the day, the New York Empire State Manufacturing Index for October will be published, and it is expected to weaken modestly, from 34.3 to 27.</p>
<p>However, investors will pay more attention <strong>to the US retail sales for September</strong>
. They expect a moderate slowdown in retail sales to -0.2% from 0.7% previously. At the same time, <strong>the ex-autos gauge is seen weakening to 0.5% from 1.8% in August</strong>
. Weaker numbers could be slightly bullish for stocks, although it looks like the Fed won't alter its hawkish stance anyway.</p>
<p>Lastly, <strong>the Michigan consumer confidence sentiment index is due</strong>
, likely increasing to 73.1 from 72.8. However, rising prices and the recent stumble in the stock markets could lead to a negative surprise.</p>
<p>From other news, the investment bank UBS sees only a modest impact on growth and inflation from the current increase in energy prices.</p>
<span class="quote-author">Our base case is that while growth rates may have peaked, growth will remain robust in the coming quarters while inflation recedes from this year's spike. We continue to see equity upside and recommend buying the winners from global growth, including energy and financials,</span>
<span class="post-quote">the bank's economists said in a note.</span>
<p>Investors now expect the Fed to start tapering in November and finish the process in July 2022. Additionally, the first rate hike will likely happen by September 2022, and another rate hike should happen soon after.</p>
<h2>Daily chart starting to look bullish again</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, <strong>the SP500 index managed to get beyond some important resistances this week.</strong>
 As a result, the daily chart looks positive again, with the medium-term uptrend likely being renewed.</p>
<p><strong>As long as it remains above the 50-day average, currently near 4,440 USD, the short-term outlook seems bullish</strong>
, but that support must be defended. Otherwise, we could see a decline toward 4,400 USD, with a possible retest of the broken, bearish trend line (at the moment, it stands at around 4,380 USD).</p>
<p><strong>The next target for bulls will likely be at previous highs near 4,485 USD</strong>
. Should it close above it on a daily chart, we might see a retest of all-time highs pretty quickly in that case.</p>

<Title>Will Bitcoin break ATH this month?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>When it comes to the main trend, I always search for the answers on the daily chart. The price level breaking through the trend line followed by the new ATH was noticeably strong and by no means do I think that it would be a false one. The zone between $ 59,700 - 60,200 is the last one before reaching the ATH. This will be a really strong resistance with which Bitcoin may have a temporary problem. However, as long as Bitcoin manages to maintain the main trend, we can perceive this chart as bullish.</p>
<p>Should the price fell through the trend line and made a new low, Bitcoin would have turned for the worse.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/BTC_1d_15_10_022fe5da3d.png" alt="BTC on a daily chart">
<span class="img-caption">Figure 1: Bitcoin on a daily chart</span>
<h2>New ATH or beginning of something new?</h2>
<p>13% is what separates us from reaching the new maximum on Bitcoin. History showed us that Bitcoin is capable to grow this much easily within one day, so we could say that the ATH is really close. Be that as it may, this could might as well be only the beginning of something way more interesting. Because if the price could get above $ 65,000 and maintained to stay there for a longer period of time, then a proper show might start. This would subsequently lead to higher media coverage and an influx of investors which is only understandable. Media are attracted to big stories and Bitcoin breaching the ATH undisputedly falls into this category.</p>
<h2>Altcoins are preparing for a break</h2>
<p>As for altcoins, they are a bit late. If we look at Bitcoin, the structure speaks quite clearly. First, we overcame the declining trend and then we set a new high and managed to stay above it. If we look at the individual altcoins, they are yet to go through this phase. However, this is nothing out of the ordinary as it is exactly how cycles on cryptocurrencies work. Bitcoin always grows first and “leads the way” for other bigger altcoins such as ETH, DOT, UNI that soon follow. Basically, we could say that Bitcoin walks so that the bigger altcoins can run. The fact that altcoins are not going through the growth phase yet does not mean that it will not happen later this month. I personally believe that we are yet to hear about them. The following chart in which I am comparing Bitcoin and Uniswap illustrates it quite clearly.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Figure 2: Bitcoin and Uniswap comparison</span>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>The situation on Bitcoin continues to improve. Again, we can see that if the markets are calm, then Bitcoin tends to grow. With both classic and cryptocurrency markets being calm last week we are close to ATH level which can quite possibly be reached this month. Let us see what does the analysis say.</Excerpt>

<Title>XAU/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.76%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.77%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.40%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.36%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>-1.58%</strong>
, which is above the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently slightly positive (<strong>1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
, which means that we estimate the middle of the growing phase of the cycle. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. The <strong>XAU/USD</strong>
 rose again above the short-term MA this week. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, only medium and long-term MAs currently support bearish sentiment.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, we have witnessed more upward trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>2</strong>
 consecutive days. However, the maximum increase was <strong>8</strong>
 days in the measured period. The downward trend in recent weeks have not exceeded more than <strong>2</strong>
 days. The maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>6</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.40%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>1.31%</strong>
, which is almost average. Approximately 90% confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.6%</strong>
 and <strong>1.6%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>Basic technical analysis still supports short-term bearish sentiment after Friday’s dynamic decline. <strong>XAU/USD</strong>
 is currently again very close to the support level of <strong>1 760</strong>
, where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50.00%</strong>
. The price is also below short-term and long-term moving averages. In addition, there is a divergence between price development and the RSI that could support this scenario. If it continues to decline, the demand zone (green rectangle), where are also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>61.80%</strong>
 and the psychological level of <strong>1 700</strong>
, could also provide some support for the bulls, as in March and early August.</p>

<Excerpt>After a positive development at the beginning of the week, almost all weekly gold gains were hammered down on Friday. However, it is still above an important level of support. The current price of XAU/USD - Gold Spot US Dollar is 1 767 (October 15, 2021). Let’s now look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>Lords of the markets: Bill Ackman</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Another of the important personalities that we will introduce to you is an American investor and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. A man who managed to earn more than two billion dollars a year ago in a market panic.</p>
<p><strong>10 points you need to know about Ackman</strong>
</p>
<li>Bill Ackman was born in 1966 into the family of a real estate businessman.</li>
<li>His first step in the world of finance was the founding of the investment company Gotham, which he co-founded in 1992 with David Berkowitz.</li>
<li>While still in Gotham, he led a dispute with the financial company MBIA. As a result, he bought credit default swaps against MBIA corporate debt and still benefited greatly during the financial crisis in 2009.</li>
<li>Another dispute was led by Ackman, directly with another US billionaire and hedge fund manager, Carl Ichan. After eight years, Ackman won.</li>
<li>In 2004, he founded the company and current flagship Pershing Square Capital Management, which today has 13.1 billion dollars Assets Under Management.</li>
<li>The second clash with Carl Ichan did not turn out so well for Ackman. His bet on the shorts of Herbalife shares turned out to be fatal, after a few years it ended in a loss of 1 billion dollars and guess who just made money on it.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, his investment strategy is highly valued and much more successful in recent years.</li>
<li>The basic and his first rule is: "Make a bold call that nobody believes in."</li>
<li>Ackman is also a prominent philanthropist, with his wife founded the Pershing Square Foundation.</li>
<li>Bill Ackman's net worth in 2021 was $ 3.3 billion, according to Forbes.</li>
<p><strong>3 quotes of Ackman</strong>
</p>
<p><em>"I think good private equity investors create a lot more economic value than they destroy."</em>
</p>
<p><em>"I am always prepared to do the right thing regardless of what other people think."</em>
</p>
<p><em>"If I believe that I am right, I will take it to the end of the earth until I am proven right."</em>

<Title>Dow looks bullish again, jumps above 50-day average</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The Dow Jones index rose comfortably above its 50-day moving average during the last two days, switching the short-term outlook to bullish again. However, Monday saw some selling and profit-taking, dragging the index lower during the London session. At the time of writing, it was down 0.35 %, trading at around 35,200 USD.</p>
<h2>Weak Chinese numbers</h2>
<p>Sentiment in the markets deteriorated notably, following weaker-than-expected Chinese macro numbers. <strong>Chinese GDP for the third quarter slowed markedly to 4.9% annualized, down from 7.9%</strong>
 in the previous quarter. Industrial production also came out much lower than forecast, printing 3.1%, way below analysts’ expectations of 4.5%, and down from 5.3% in the previous month. However, Chinese retail sales surprised to the upside and printed 4.4%, up from 2.5% in August.</p>
<p>Traders might pay attention to the <strong>US industrial production data due later in the day</strong>
.  Industrial production is expected to decline notably and effectively halving to 0.2% in August, down from 0.4% recently. Capacity utilization figures will also be released,  but they normally don’t cause any market volatility.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <strong>US monthly budget statement will be published</strong>
, summarizing the financial activities of federal entities, disbursing officers, and Federal Reserve banks.</p>
<p>More data will be released tomorrow, including the US building permits and housing starts for September.</p>
<p>As we have said many times, the fundamental long-term situation remains bullish for US equities since the Fed is in no hurry to exit its ultra-loose monetary policy. <strong>The market now expects the Fed to hike rates by September 2022 and finish its tapering process by July 2022.</strong>
 However, equity markets look resilient, and traders largely ignore the hawkish shift at the central bank. Therefore, the latest correction now looks like another buying opportunity.</p>
<h2>Daily chart turns bullish again</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, the significant support now remains near 34,900 USD, where the 50-day moving average is located and is converged with previous highs. As long as the Dow Jones Index trades above it, <strong>the short-term trend seems bullish</strong>
.</p>
<p>Should the index decline below its 50-day average, we could see another leg lower toward the 34,600 USD support zone. In that case, the short-term bias could change back to bearish.</p>
<p>However, <strong>it looks like the recent correction in stocks might be over since all of the major indices jumped above their contemporary bearish trend lines</strong>
, indicating a possible leg higher in the following days.</p>
<p>In that scenario, the next target for the Dow Jones index could be set at the current all-time highs, seen at around 35,600 USD.</p>

<Title>Aussie targets 200-day average in the current leg higher</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian dollar is trading higher again, rising 0.7% during the US session and changing hands at around 0.74600.</p>
<p>It looks like the Australian dollar will easily breach the resistance of September highs near 0.7470 and continue higher above the critical 0.75 threshold.</p>
<p>The US dollar was broadly lower today, <strong>pushing the dollar Index toward the essential support of previous highs near 93.50</strong>
. However, should the index drop below the mentioned support, we could see further US dollar weakness, possibly helping the Aussie climb above the mentioned 0.75 resistance.</p>
<h2>Pessimistic RBA minutes</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, the Reserve Bank of Australia published its minutes from the latest monetary policy meeting, <strong>saying that the inflation target of 2-3%, required before the central bank will lift the cash rate, will not be met until 2024</strong>
.</p>
<p>(Because of the neverending lockdown), the economic recovery was likely to be slower than in late 2020/early 2021.</p>
<p>Overall the minutes sounded somewhat dovish and negative, but the Australian dollar strengthened anyway. That is because the market is pricing a more hawkish RBA than it actually is. Since the Fed is expected to start hiking rates by September 2022, and the RBA again confirmed that it should start raising rates only in 2024, <strong>that's a massive time gap between those two central banks</strong>
. As a result, it should support the US dollar over the Australian dollar in the medium term.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Australian One Hundred Dollar Bills, viewed through a magnifying glass, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<h2>Commodities fuel the rally</h2>
<p>Furthermore, <strong>the Aussie remains supported by the rising commodities</strong>
. For instance, <strong>copper has been up more than 10% over the last two weeks</strong>
. In addition, gold and silver rallied today, with silver soaring nearly 4% at the time of writing. Lastly, oil is also helping as the WTI Benchmark continues to climb every day, currently trading near 83 USD a barrel, a level last seen in the Fall of 2014.</p>
<p>Later in the day, <strong>the US building permits and housing starts data will be published</strong>
. However, these figures usually don't cause any market volatility.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Financial Management Service will release the US monthly budget statement, summarizing the financial activities of federal entities, disbursing officers, and Federal Reserve banks.</p>
<p>From the technical point of view, the next strong resistance is expected to be at the mentioned September highs near 0.7480. If the Australian dollar rises above that selling zone, <strong>it'll likely target the 200-day moving average, approximately at 0.7550.</strong>
</p>
<p>Alternatively, bulls could find support near the 0.74 level, where previous highs and lows are converged. As long as the Aussie remains above this level, the short-term outlook seems bullish. Thus, dips are expected to be bought.</p>

<Title>USD/CAD hitting multi-month lows amid USD weakness, soaring oil</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The USD/CAD pair continued to decline today, and it was trading at around 1.2350 on Wednesday, waiting for today’s inflation report.</p>
<h2>Inflation moving markets today</h2>
<p>Later in the day, Canadian inflation is expected to rise further, with <strong>the Consumer Price Index forecast to tick higher to 4.3% yearly, up from 4.1% scored in August</strong>
.  Additionally, the core indicator will likely accelerate as well, seen printing 3.6%, up from 3.5% previously. As a result, the month-on-month change is expected to rise for both the normal and the core indicator.</p>
<p>There are no US data on the agenda today. Therefore, <strong>the current anti-dollar sentiment could continue</strong>
, possibly keeping the greenback under pressure.</p>
<p><strong>The USD/CAD pair fell to the lowest level since the beginning of July</strong>
, undermined by the broad US dollar weakness and rising oil prices. There is usually a positive correlation between the Canadian dollar and oil. Oil continues to perform exceptionally well, with <strong>the WTI oil benchmark rising above the 83 USD threshold, the highest since October 2014.</strong>
</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar should also perform well as long as oil continues in its medium and long-term uptrends.</p>
<p>It looks like the US dollar has failed to capitalize on the rising US yields, which used to be one of the most important fundamental drivers for the USD. <strong>The short-term two-year US yield doubled over the last month</strong>
, rising from 0.2% to 0.4%, <strong>but not helping the USD/CAD pair to advance higher</strong>
.</p>
<h2>BoC remains optimistic</h2>
<p>From other news, the Bank of Canada’s BoC Business Outlook Survey for the third quarter revealed Monday that the business sentiment continued to improve, with the survey indicator hitting a record high of 4.73, compared to 3.96 in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Additionally, expectations for 1-year ahead inflation increased to a record high 3.72%; spike seen as temporary. Finally, 45% of firms expect total CPI to be above 3% over the next two years; half of those firms say drivers of higher inflation are temporary.</p>
<p>Inflation expectations are not anchored and continue to rise,  most likely prompting the Bank of Canada to start hiking rates next year.</p>
<h2>Daily chart looks bearish</h2>
<p>The following support seems to be in the 1.23 region. If not held by bulls, we could see another leg lower, targeting the psychological level of 1.20, where the current cycle lows are also located from the summer.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the USD needs to rise above 1.25 to cancel the immediate bearish threat. Till then, the short and medium-term outlooks seem bearish.</p>

<Title>FTSE stuck near previous highs</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The FTSE 100 index, also known as the Footsie index, failed to settle above previous highs and corrected lower. As a result, sentiment appears slightly negative today, possibly leading to a more significant correction from the strong resistance of 7,240 GBP.</p>
<h2>Inflation slows but remains elevated.</h2>
<p>This week's <strong>inflation data released Wednesday showed that inflation has slowed marginally</strong>
. Still, the overall trend remains higher, possibly <strong>prompting the Bank of England to start raising rides as soon as the next meeting.</strong>
</p>
<p>The CPI inflation has slowed to 3.1% annually in September, down a notch from 3.2% in August. The core CPI also ticked lower and printed 2.9%, down from 3.1% previously. However, economists predict that inflation will continue rising as the energy crisis is far from over and supply chain distortions remain intact.</p>
<p>Sterling has jumped notably over the previous three weeks, rising from 1.34 to 1.38 against the Greenback. There usually is a negative correlation between the pound and the FTSE index. Should the GBP continue to strengthen, the equity index might decline from the mentioned resistance.</p>
<p>On the macro front, data released earlier by the Office for National Statistics showed <strong>UK public borrowing fell by almost half in the first six months</strong>
 of the financial year. It continued to recover from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>However, <strong>Britain's budget deficit soared last financial year to its highest since World War Two at 15% of GDP</strong>
. Still, it is expected to halve this year due to the end of emergency economic support and more substantial tax revenues.</p>
<p><strong>The coronavirus situation in the UK is deteriorating.</strong>
 The number of new cases and deaths has increased notably, prompting fears that new measures and lockdowns could be implemented over the winter to stop the spread.</p>
<p>In that scenario, it would most likely be negative for UK equities as the government would put many small businesses into a challenging situation again.</p>
<h2>Daily chart points to further consolidation</h2>
<p>Since June. <strong>the FTSE index has been stuck in a wide range and has not moved anywhere in more than six months</strong>
. Therefore, the medium-term outlook remains neutral.</p>
<p>The Footsie needs to rise above the significant selling zone at previous highs in the 7,240 GBP zone. If successful, large stop-losses of short positions will be triggered, likely sending the index sharply higher in the initial reaction.</p>
<p>In that scenario, the Footsie might advance to the 7,400 - 7,600 GBP area, where the pre-COVID highs are located. <strong>However, please note that the FTSE index is the weakest among the major indices as it still trades below the February highs.</strong>
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the support is seen near 7,150 - 7,160 GBP, followed by the the 50-day moving average near 7,110 GBP.</p>

<Title>USANA Health Sciences Inc (USNA) - basic stock analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>3.06%</strong>
 and <strong>-2.78%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>1.48%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.26%</strong>
. Today´s return was only <strong>0.73%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>2</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the extreme of a positive short-term phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. As we can see in the chart below, all MAs are currently in bullish sentiment after the market price has risen above the monthly MA.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Our estimated Earnings Power Value (EPV) is <strong>113 USD</strong>
 and the Growth Value (GV) is approximately the same. The potential opportunity for growth is based on the value of EPV and % of reinvested earnings. NAV is represented by the Total Stockholders' equity. The following chart uses the value from the last fiscal year.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>2.53%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>1.35%</strong>
, which is well below average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-6.25%</strong>
 and <strong>6.25%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>10.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/211021_LH_cee7f1800d.jpg" alt="USNA low to high distribution">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to a sideways trending this year. The channel ranges from about <strong>88 USD</strong>
 up to <strong>102 USD</strong>
. The lower boundary of the channel is also formed by the psychological level. According to our estimate of intrinsic value, the market price is currently slightly above the negative (<strong>96 USD</strong>
 – red highlight) but still below the neutral (<strong>126 USD</strong>
 – blue highlight) scenario. In addition, the positive scenario (<strong>160 USD</strong>
) estimates the intrinsic value at new historical highs. The last upward rebound was very consistent, however, the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>61.80%</strong>
 together with the divergence between the price development and the RSI could slow down the bulls a bit.</p>

<Title>EUR/USD advances ahead of Powell’s speech</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The greenback quickly erased yesterday’s gains and dropped on Friday, with the EUR/USD pair trading 0.3% stronger at around 1.1650.</p>
<p>Earlier, <strong>German manufacturing and services PMI for October dropped on a monthly basis</strong>
, sending the composite PMI from 55.5 to 52, getting dangerously close to the critical 50 threshold. The same scenario was seen for the EU composite PMI, and it slowed to 54.3 in October, down from 56.2 in September.</p>
<span class="quote-author">Given the auto sector continues to suffer, the risks are to the downside for manufacturing in Germany and the eurozone. Worse than expected PMI data today would certainly reinforce Lagarde’s position in arguing at the ECB press conference next week that inflation will prove transitory and that the energy price spike is contractionary, </span>
<span class="post-quote">economists at MUFG Bank reported today.</span>
<p>Later in the trading session, <strong>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is due to participate in a virtual panel discussion</strong>
 titled “Monetary and financial stability challenges to central banks in the wake of COVID-19” at an online conference hosted by the South African Reserve Bank. He will likely talk about monetary policy, possibly influencing the markets and causing volatility.</p>
<p><strong>Investors will also pay attention to the Flash services and manufacturing PMIs for October</strong>
, both expected to remain near their last month’s values.</p>
<p>Additionally, the US Treasury Currency Report is expected to be released, providing a detailed review of global exchange rate policies, economic conditions, and central bank and government actions worldwide. The report also outlines countries that the Treasury deems currency manipulators.</p>
<h2>Daily chart a bit neutral at the moment</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, it looks like the EUR/USD pair has bottomed slightly above the 1.15 level. The USD continues to decline, despite soaring US yields, a rather unusual behavior. Still, <strong>the target for bulls in the current leg higher is at the 50-day moving average, currently near 1.17.</strong>
</p>
<p>Before that, <strong>the euro needs to climb above previous lows at 1.1660</strong>
, which is a meaningful resistance. Jumping above the 1.17 level would likely cancel the medium-term bearish trend.</p>
<p>On the downside, the support is seen in the 1.1615 area, followed by the current cycle lows at around 1.1530. The euro continues to be supported by the declining trend line (as shown on the chart). It implies the next possible downward target near 1.15 should bears regain control.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Reaching new ATH - what is next?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Before I start the analysis, I want to say that I personally believe that Bitcoin for 100 000 USD by the end of the year is more than possible. To support this statement, here are my ideas. First of all, traditional markets are in relatively good shape and my followers know that I believe that the good condition of tradition markets is one of the main reasons for crypto runs. Thus, if the traditional markets are stable, I think crypto can go higher. Well and during these days we can see that S&P 500 is attacking its ATH and NASDAQ has even reached it this week. If these markets can continue rising, I see no reason why crypto would not.</p>
<p>I also think that media and press have a role in what´s coming. Press loves hot stories and breaking news and this can influence newcomers to come to join this space. This can increase the inflow of the capital into the cryptocurrencies, leading to 100 000 dollars.</p>
<h3>But what does the chart say?</h3>
<p>Right now we are in the price discovery stage. To put it simply, this means that after any financial asset reaches its ATH, new rise can be expected to the areas, where it has not been before. This is usually supported by the press, because ATH is exactly the type of “hot story” that I mentioned before. This can also lead to lurking in the newcomers, who might have the feeling that their ship has sailed and they need to invest right now to make some money. This is obviously not true.</p>
<p>For the middle term I see 69 583 USD as one of the key levels, with 78 830 USD as the next one. If everything goes as planned, these two levels can be expected in the coming weeks.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Longer term outlook on Bitcoin, Source: Authors´ analysis</span>
<h3>Short term uncertainty?</h3>
<p>While looking more into the future seems like an easy task as we should continue with the bull market, the more short term analysis is a bit messy. Bitcoin is still safely about the trendline. This is the same trendline that pushed us above the ATH levels. Yet, if at any point the trendline is broken down, we can see panic and probably a more significant selloff. It is however very plausible that this selloff would be met with a sharp recovery.</p>
<p>Currently I am looking at 4H chart and the MA21 and whether we push further away from the trendline. In the short term we can also seen the price falling, yet, I would not worry about this for the longer time frame.</p>

<Excerpt>Bitcoin did not take long to reach new ATH. The biggest cryptocurrency was even quick enough to reach it before the end of October. Now we can see that all eyes are watching the 100 000 USD mark. Is it possible by the end of the year to see 6-digits and what can we expect in the coming days?</Excerpt>

<Title>Correction fears are over - indices are looking at their all time highs!</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Today we will look at two fundamental indices which I believe look very bullish and where I can see the trend continuation.
These two indices will be S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Both of these looked like they were going into deeper correction only while ago. However, it turns out that it was only a bit of a retracement, which is very common during September (speaking historically) and can now lead to more uptrend.</p>
<h3>S&P 500</h3>
<p>This index is currently testing its ATH. I do not think that this is a question of if we reach ATH, but rather when we reach it. I can even imagine S&P 500 trading at levels of 4 800 in the coming weeks. I have highlighted two possible scenarios that I can see in the upcoming days, but both of them can lead to ATH.</p>

<span class="img-caption">S&P 500 index outlook, Source: Authors´ analysis</span>
<h3>NASDAQ</h3>
<p>NASDAQ was one of the first indices that created a new ATH. This technology index saw only a short and relatively insignificant correction. It was thus expected to see this index climb higher, with other indices following. NASDAQ is also still above the main trendline and until this changes, I think we are on a road to 210.</p>

<span class="img-caption">NASDAQ index outlook, Source: Authors´ analysis</span>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I personally believe that the indices are in a good shape. Every time you see a correction, it is important to try to find out whether it is or whether it is not significant for longer time frame. In this case it was not, and that is a reason why might be able to see ATH soon.</p>

<Excerpt>It only took couple of weeks to see the tables turn completely. While only few weeks ago we saw panic spreading around the Evergrande problems, which was compared to Lehman Brothers, it only took a bit of time to see indices looking at their respective ATH again.</Excerpt>

<Title>XCU/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.25%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.20%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.63%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.58%</strong>
. Today´s return is <strong>-1.32%</strong>
, which is slightly below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently very negative (<strong>-3</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-3</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the extreme negative phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. The <strong>XCU/USD</strong>
 rose above short-term and medium-term MAs last week. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, all MAs support bullish sentiment.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, we have witnessed more upward trends that did not exceed <strong>2</strong>
 consecutive days. The total maximum in the measured period (last 3 years) is <strong>11</strong>
 days. Also, downward trends in recent months have not exceeded more than <strong>2</strong>
 days. The total maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>12</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.83%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.75%</strong>
, which is more than the average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-2.5%</strong>
 and <strong>2.5%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>3.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<p>The basic technical analysis points to a sideways trending since March this year. The channel ranges from approximately <strong>4.000</strong>
 USD up to <strong>4.800</strong>
 USD. The lower boundary of channel is formed by the psychological level and the demand zone (green rectangle). The upper limit of channel is also formed by the psychological level and the supply zone (red rectangle). The <strong>XCU/USD</strong>
 is currently above the short-term and long-term moving averages, which could act as supports.</p>

<Excerpt>The change in inventory by LME warehouses is still negative after almost a month. The negative correlation of this indicator thus confirms the positive momentum of the price for the last month. The current price of XCU/USD - Copper Spot US Dollar is 4.526 (October 22, 2021). Therefore, we will now look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>DAX struggling at 50-day average</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>German Dax index is trying to jump above its 50-day moving average on Monday. At the time of writing, it was trading somewhat higher on the day, last seen at around 15,600 EUR.</p>
<p><strong>German IFO surveys came out weaker-than-expected earlier in the day</strong>
 as the expectations sub-index dropped to 95.4 in October, down from 97.4 previously. Likewise, the business climate gauge declined to 97.7, below  98.9 printed in September. The current assessment index also slowed to 100.1. <strong>The Euro fell some 30 pips after the numbers</strong>
 and traded at daily lows near 1.1625, helping the DAX index slightly.</p>
<span class="quote-author">Supply chain problems are causing trouble for companies, production capacities are falling. In the manufacturing sector, business sentiment has fallen, same with services and trade. German economy is facing an uncomfortable autumn,</span>
<span class="post-quote">the IFO institute’s Economist Klaus Wohlrabe said after the release.</span>
<p><strong>There is usually a negative correlation between the Euro and German export-oriented stocks.</strong>
 Therefore, when the Euro declines, the DAX index is often in a bullish regime.</p>
<p>There are no other macro data on the agenda today, leaving trading to technical factors and sentiment for the rest of the day. However, <strong>since the US markets are trading near all-time highs, the bull market might continue, possibly helping the EU indices.</strong>
</p>
<p>From other news, the European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council member and Spanish central bank chief Pablo Hernandez de Cos said Monday that supply chain problems and rising raw material prices affect negatively economic recovery pace. <strong>So likely we'll keep observing relatively high inflation rates in coming months.</strong>
</p>
<h2>ECB takes center stage</h2>
<p>The <strong>European Central Bank will decide about monetary policy Thursday</strong>
,  likely leaving all settings unchanged. Thus, monetary policy will remain highly loose, further supporting risk assets such as stocks and commodities.</p>
<p>Judging from the recent comments by the ECB governors, the central bank will be in no rush to tighten monetary policy. On the other hand, the Fed is expected to start tapering in November, with the process likely ending in July. Additionally, markets are currently pricing nearly two rate hikes in 2022, causing a <strong>significant divergence between the EU and the US</strong>
 in their respective monetary policies.</p>
<p>In that scenario, the EUR/USD pair might continue trending lower, further supporting German stocks.</p>
<h2>Daily chart remains bullish</h2>
<p>Technically speaking,  <strong>the DAX index needs to rise above the strong resistance at 15,600 EUR</strong>
. Then, if bulls are successful, the index might continue toward its all-time high near the 16,000 EUR threshold.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if bears defend the 50-day moving average, we could see some frustration among bulls and a possible correction toward the last week’s lows near 15,400 EUR.</p>

<Title>GBP/JPY defends previous highs</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The Pound continued its strong uptrend and was seen nearly 1% stronger Tuesday, trading above the key short-term support.</p>
<h2>UK stands behind its workers</h2>
<p>On Monday, news appeared that <strong>Chancellor Rishi Sunak was preparing to raise the national living wage to 9.50 GBP per hour</strong>
 as part of Wednesday's budget, giving British workers an extra 1,000 GBP per year.</p>
<p>The national living wage - the national minimum wage for anybody over the age of 22 - will increase from 8.91 GBP per hour, while Britons aged 21-22 will see an increase to 9.18 GBP an hour from 8.36 GBP, and apprentices 16 and over and not in full-time education will get a rise to 4.81 GBP from 4.30 GBP an hour.</p>
<p>“This is a government that is on the side of working people,” Sunak said.</p>
<p>There are no UK macro data on the schedule this week. Thus, <strong>traders might focus on the US macro news, usually causing volatility in the major USD pairs</strong>
 but moving FX crosses as well.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, <strong>US durable goods for September will be released and are expected to weaken notably</strong>
. Additionally, <strong>Thursday will see the US GDP for the third quarter, forecast to drop significantly</strong>
 to 2.5% annually, down from 6.7% previously.</p>
<p>The final day of the week will belong to the US PCE inflation indices - the Fed’s favorite tool of measuring inflation. Inflation is expected to rise further to 4.7% year-over-year, more than double the current Fed’s target of 2.0%.</p>
<h2>Bank of Japan decision due</h2>
<p>From the Japanese Yen point of view, <strong>Thursday will bring the Bank of Japan monetary policy</strong>
. The BoJ remains ultra dovish, and it will likely reiterate that it is ready to lose monetary policy further, possibly undermining the JPY.</p>
<p>Friday will bring a large batch of JPY data, such as the unemployment rate, industrial production, housing starts, construction orders, Tokyo CPI, etc.</p>
<h2>Bulls remain in charge</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, the daily chart remains bullish. This week’s minor correction brought the price to previous cycle highs at 156.00, now acting as significant short-term support. As long as sterling trades above it, the short-term uptrend remains intact.</p>
<p>However, if the GBP/JPY cross declines below 156.00, larger stop-losses of long positions could be hit, likely driving the Pound toward its 50-day moving average, currently in the 152.50 zone.</p>
<p>On the upside, <strong>the resistance is now seen at the cycle top - near 158.00</strong>
. If taken out, the cross could continue toward the psychological level of 160.00.</p>

<Title>Cirrus Logic Inc (CRUS) - basic stock analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>2.96%</strong>
 and <strong>-2.76%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>1.44%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.33%</strong>
. Today´s return was only <strong>-0.72%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>1</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the middle of a positive short-term phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. As we can see in the chart below, all MAs are currently in bearish sentiment after the market price recently fell below them.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Our estimated Earnings Power Value (EPV) is <strong>USD 121</strong>
 and the Growth Value (GV) is approximately the same. The potential opportunity for growth is based on the value of EPV and % of reinvested earnings. NAV is represented by the Total Stockholders' equity. The following chart uses the value from the last fiscal year.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>2.85%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>1.32%</strong>
, which is well below average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-6.00%</strong>
 and <strong>6.00%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>9.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to a sideways trending this year. The main channel ranges from about <strong>USD 72</strong>
 to <strong>USD 88</strong>
. The level of Fibonacci retracement of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 is very close to the upper limit and therefore acts as a resistance to the market price. The lower limit of channel is formed by the psychological level. The demand zone (green rectangle) together with the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50.00%</strong>
 confirms its importance. According to our estimate of the intrinsic value, the market price is currently above the negative (<strong>USD 75</strong>
 – red highlight) but still below the neutral (<strong>USD 82</strong>
 – blue highlight) scenario. The positive scenario (<strong>USD 98</strong>
) estimates the intrinsic value at the highs of early <strong>2021</strong>
.</p>

<Title>CAD surges after hawkish Bank of Canada decision</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The USD/CAD pair was down 0.5% Wednesday, trading at around 1.2340 as traders were surprised by a relatively hawkish Bank of Canada monetary policy decision.</p>
<h2>Bank of Canada surprises</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, the Canadian central bank led by Governor Tiff Macklem announced <strong>it would end its quantitative easing program that has poured hundreds of billions into the financial system</strong>
 since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Thus, <strong>the bank is ending quantitative easing (QE) and moving into the reinvestment phase</strong>
, during which it will purchase Government of Canada bonds solely to replace maturing bonds.
Additionally, the central bank pledged not to raise the benchmark overnight policy rate until the recovery is complete. Still, <strong>central bank governors now think that will happen in the “middle quarters’’ of 2022</strong>
, bringing it forward from the second half of next year as previously thought.</p>
<h2>US data under scrutiny</h2>
<p>Traders also paid attention to US durable goods orders for September, released today. They slowed notably to -0.4% from 1.3% previously, although the number was better than -1.1% expected. Core durable goods orders ticked higher a notch to 0.4% from 0.3% in August.</p>
<p><strong>Orders placed with US factories for business equipment rose in September for a seventh straight month</strong>
, pointing to ongoing strength in capital investment. However, the US dollar remained broadly lower after the data.</p>
<p>The USD/CAD pair trades close to its four-month lows as rising oil prices have supported the Canadian dollar. The WTI benchmark has recently traded as high as 85 USD, printing fresh seven-year highs. As long as oil remains in such a steep uptrend, the CAD should strengthen further.</p>
<p><strong>The pair is now testing significant support in the 1.2550 – 1.23 zone</strong>
. Some larger stop-losses could be triggered if bears push the USD below it, likely sending the greenback further lower. The medium-term target remains at summer lows at the psychological 1.20 zone.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the greenback needs to rise above 1.25 to cancel the immediate bearish trend, which right now looks unlikely.
The USD has failed to benefit from the recent surge in US yields, reinforcing the current bearish narrative in the USD/CAD pair.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>The CAD soared after the recent BoC action, but it needs to push the USD/CAD pair below 1.23 to continue strengthening.</Excerpt>

<Title>EUR/JPY falls ahead of ECB meeting</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The EUR/JPY cross was trading 0.3% weaker during the Frankfurt session on Thursday as traders digested the Bank of Japan monetary policy meeting, with the European Central Bank policy decision due later in the day.</p>
<p>From minor macro news, the <strong>German unemployment rate slightly improved to 5.4% in October</strong>
, while the unemployment change decreased further to -39,000 (which is positive), from -30,000 previously.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer confidence in the eurozone continues to decline and printed -4.8 for October</strong>
, down from -4 in September. On the other hand, the economic sentiment indicator rose marginally to 118.6, from 117.8 scored in the previous month.</p>
<h2>Dovish Bank of Japan</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, the Bank of Japan left monetary policy unchanged, as widely expected.</p>
<p>The central bank’s Governor <strong>Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated that the central bank would ease policy further without hesitation as needed</strong>
. He also said that the BoJ needs to pay attention to the impact of coronavirus on domestic and overseas economies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Kuroda does not think that US tapering has a direct impact on interest rates, currencies. The central bank also said that <strong>domestic inflation would not reach elevated levels as elsewhere in the world.</strong>
</p>
<p>Finally, the Bank of Japan upgraded its long-term growth forecast for 2022 to 2.9% from the previous estimate of 2.7% but downgraded its 2021 outlook from 3.8% to 3.4%.</p>
<h2>ECB also dovish?</h2>
<p>Later in the day, the European Central Bank decides about monetary policy. The primary interest rate will stay unchanged at 0.0%. However, the following statement will be of major importance, considering the soaring inflation in the eurozone. The EURUSD pair was seen at around 1.16, heading into the decision.</p>
<span class="quote-author">They will clearly articulate they have confidence in the recovery, but will also note they see little need to raise rates to end-2023 given inflation. The medium-term rates outlook for the ECB is at odds with both the US FOMC and UK’s BoE,</span>
<span class="post-quote">analysts at Westpac said on Thursday.</span>
<p>Elsewhere, <strong>the 5yr5yr Euro inflation swaps hit 2% for the first time on Friday,</strong>
 so it appears the market believes the ECB has achieved long-term success in hitting its inflation mandate.</p>
<p>Traders will also pay attention to the US GDP data for the third quarter. The annual change is forecast to decline notably to 2.7%, down from 6.7% previously. The GDP price index will likely decrease to 5.4%. Additionally, the usual Thursday's jobless claims are due.</p>
<p><strong>As long as the EUR/JPY cross trades above the significant support zone of 130.40 - 130.70</strong>
, the medium-term outlook should remain bullish, targeting the current cycle highs at around 134.00.</p>

<Title>Musk is by far the richest person on Earth - Tesla breaking records</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Share price on a rise</h2>
<p>This immediately reflected on the price of Tesla shares. Ever since the news broke out the shares of this company increased by 20 %. Yet, the attention around Tesla has been there for more tahn couple of days, since the shares of Tesla very already considered to be in a bubble. Nevertheless, Tesla broke its ATH, which means that it is now in a price discovery stage.</p>
<p>What does this mean? Well looking from the perspective of Technical Analysis, there is a huge advantage to breaking the ATH since there are no more resistances above the price that could push it down. It is very common to see the shares, as well as cryptocurrencies, to rise right after they broke their previous ATH.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Share price of Tesla</span>
<h2>Tesla versus the rest of automotive companies</h2>
<p>If you still believe that the shares of Tesla are not in the bubble and its rise is based on reasonable fundamentals, let´s have a look at the graphics below. As of now,  Tesla has the same market capitalisation as all the other automotive companies combined. And we are not talking about small companies, but car giants like Mercedes, BMW, Ferrari, Volkswagen or Toyota, which are responsible for majority of car sales.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Market value of Tesla vs other automative companies, Source: wolfstreet.com</span>
<h2>Musk is by far the richest person on the planet</h2>
<p>The rise of Tesla shares not only meant that the company made its ATH in several metrics, but it also helped its CEO to become by far the richest person on the planet. Last few weeks we were able to see some kind of the “back-and-forth” between Musk and Bezos, when it comes to their wealth, but thanks to this rise Musk took the lead. Only this year, Elon Musk has made more money than legendary investor Warren Buffet over his entire career. And that is definitely something.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>What is the reason behind the increasing attention to Elon Musk and Tesla in the past couple of days? One can say that it is due to the biggest car rental company in the United  States – Hertz. This company has made a deal Tesla to buy more than 100 000 cars, which it plans to rent out in the future.</Excerpt>

<Title>From 8 000 dollars to 5,7 billion - a story of crazy Shiba Inu run</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Single best trade ever?</h2>
<p>Imagine that you have invested 8 000 dollars into Shiba Inu last August. If that was your case, now you would be sitting at around 5,7 billion dollars. Yes that is what actually happened as the cryptocurrency community pointed out in several Twitter threads. There has been an anonymous hodler of a Shiba Inu wallet, who invested 8 000 dollars to this “dog coin,” which in a year made him billions of dollars.</p>
<p>And that is mostly thanks to the crazy run that this cryptocurrency is having now. The October 2021 has so far been the best month for this cryptocurrency in its history, since the project grew by more than 1 000 % and made its ATH (all time high) at around 0.000088 dollars. That is however not all.</p>
<h2>Getting to the top</h2>
<p>Shiba Inu also made it to the TOP 10 of the cryptocurrency list. Currently sitting at the 9. spot when it comes to total market capitalisation of the cryptocurrencies with around 40 billion dollars, Shiba Inu was also able to outpace its biggest competitor and most famous meme coin, Dogecoin, which is a beloved cryptocurrency of Elon Musk. These 2 dog coins are now having a bit of a dog fight for the 9. spot.</p>
<p>It is also increasingly interesting to see that the hype that is around this meme coin, is also built upon some fundamentals. For instance, the project has seen incredible volumes. To be more precise, on average, this cryptocurrency is currently the third when it comes to average daily volumes only behind Bitcoin and Tether.</p>
<p>Moreover, more and more people are joining in as the average daily increase in the hodlers of this coin has been 30 000 per day. Yesterday, Shiba Inu had around 800 000 hodlers, which is significantly lower than Dogecoin (around 4,5 million wallets), yet, it is in a steady rise since the beginning of October. Some even suggest, that this “crazy hype” that is behind the rise of this cryptocurrency is a reason why Coinbase and Cryptocom exchanges had outages yesterday. Apparently, the volume of trades was so high that these exchanges were not able to meet the demand and crashed.</p>
<p>Yet, it is still important to have in mind that Shiba Inu is just another memecoin. Compared to projects like Ethereum, Cardano, Binance Coin or Polkadot, Shiba Inu has very little to offer so far and mostly can be considered as a speculative investment.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>We are almost certain that most of you have already seen some news about the cryptocurrency that goes by the name of Shiba Inu. This “dog coin” is having crazy run, which is also a source of a crazy stories.</Excerpt>

<Title>Gold remains below long-term uptrend line</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Again, the bullion failed to settle above the crucial 1,800 USD and traded weaker Friday, last seen at around 1,792 USD.</p>
<h2>US GDP disappoints</h2>
<p>Thursday, the third quarter US GDP was released, and it was <strong>the lowest since the Covid-collapse quarter of Q2 2020</strong>
 when GDP crashed more than 30%. <strong>It came out at 2.0%, missing estimates of 2.6%, and it was a significant drop from the 6.7% final Q2 GDP number</strong>
. The deceleration in real Q3 GDP was led by a slowdown in consumer spending, which dropped to 1.6% from 12.0%.</p>
<p>The US dollar declined after the data, but gold and silver failed to rally and remained muted on the day, with renewed selling hitting the metals today.</p>
<p>Later during the US session, <strong>the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge - PCE inflation indices</strong>
 - will be released. According to this measure, inflation is forecast to continue rising and should print 4.7% year-on-year, up from 4.3% in August. In addition, the core PCE index is expected to tick higher to 3.7%. Both numbers are well above the Fed’s 2% inflation target, prompting the central bank to start tapering its asset purchases.</p>
<p><strong>The market currently prices more than two rate hikes in 2022</strong>
, but the Fed’s projections are not that hawkish.</p>
<p>Moreover, the employment cost index is due today, along with personal spending and income data. Lastly, the Chicago PMI index for October is on the agenda, forecast to slow from 64.7 to 63.5.</p>
<p>It looks like the US dollar is about to end its medium-term uptrend, despite rising yields and rate-hike expectations. The dollar index dropped below previous highs of 93.50 and is currently testing its 50-day moving average. The EURUSD pair also advanced to the same moving average. Should the dollar continue to decline, precious metals might be supported.</p>
<h2>Daily chart seems neutral</h2>
<p><strong>Gold is having issues climbing above the last long-term bullish trend line</strong>
, currently slightly above the 1,800 USD. Bulls need to push the metal above that level to confirm the medium-term bullish momentum. In that case, the critical resistance is still at 1,835 USD, and it needs to be cleared to the upside for the long-term uptrend to resume.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a nice <strong>rising wedge pattern is forming on the daily chart, which is a reversal formation</strong>
. Should gold drop below 1,790 USD, the shape could become valid, targeting 1,750 USD in the initial wave.</p>
<p>If the rising wedge pattern becomes active, the 50-day moving average at 1,780 USD could offer some support.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Is Bitcoin ready for new ATH after few flash crashes?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>In the last 3 days, we have seen at least 2 significant flash crashes (sharp downwards movements), yet, in both cases, the price quickly rose up again. In the second case it all even happened within the same 4-hour candle. What does this mean?</p>
<h2>Weekly timeframe</h2>
<p>The weekly chart shows one terribly looking candle. The last red candle, which had a long wick and shows TOP for now might look a bit worrying. I believe that the strongest support we have is somewhere between 52 900 – 55 500 USD. However, this does not mean that since there is one ugly candle, we have to break this support. On contrary, we do not even have to come to those levels. This week, the weekly candle will also be closed with a monthly candle, which means there might be more volatility ahead of us in the coming few days. If we hold the above-mentioned support, we do not have to worry at all.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin 1W  chart with main supports</span>
<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>Looking at daily chart, we can see that both the support and trendline are equally important, but as of now, we are a bit too far from both of these levels. We should not be even talking about bear market, until we break both of these supports. Yes, the lower timeframes might look a bit more edgy due to several panic sells and flash crashes, but if you are not sure what trend you are in, always zoom out. These crashes have not invalidated any important levels and therefore there is no reason to be bearish.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin 1D chart with main supports and trendline</span>
<h2>4-hour chart</h2>
<p>The 4-hour chart shows nice ABC correction in a wedge. Bitcoin has 3 important resistances above the price right now, which are blocking the biggest cryptocurrency from the upward movement. These are 1. MA 22 – which we have just broken, 2. MA 77 - which we are testing at the time of writing this article and 3. Trendline – which again, is just being tested.</p>
<p>Until we break these three resistances, we cannot be looking at any type of massive uptrend. This can take even few more days, however, there is no question of whether we will break them (but rather when). Yesterday the bears tried once again to push Bitcoin down,  but they were unsuccessful and thus I believe that the time for new ATH is coming.</p>

<Title>Lords of the markets: Carl Icahn</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The last time we wrote about Bill Ackman, who, among other things, clashed hard with another investment giant, Carl Icahn, and we will focus on that magician in an article today.</p>
<p><strong>10 points you need to know about Ackman</strong>
</p>
<li>Carl Icahn was born in 1936 and he is ethnically Jewish.</li>
<li>Icahn studied philosophy at Princeton University. It is also interesting that he attended, but did not complete, medical studies in New York.</li>
<li>Soon after he became a stockbroker and then a manager in an investment company.</li>
<li>However, his rich career began in 1968, when he founded a Icahn & Co. that have traded in arbitrage and options.</li>
<li>During the following years, under his management, there were very interesting deals in the purchase and sale of the company on the stock exchange, which earned him profits in the tens of millions of dollars.</li>
<li>Thanks to a specific style for his business goals, which is called "asset stripping", he gained a reputation on the market as the so-called raider.</li>
<li>In the following years, his investment appetite certainly did not decrease, so the companies in his portfolio included such well-known names as Pam Am, Marvel Comics, Netflix, Apple, or Herbalife.</li>
<li>The last mentioned company was the subject of a clash of the titans between him and Bill Ackman. The winner was Icahn in the end.</li>
<li>Icahn was also for some time an independent „special adviser“ to President D. Trump. He is a philanthropist and founder of the Children's Rescue Fund.</li>
<li>Carl Icahn 's net worth in 2021 was $ 17.4 billion, according to Forbes.</li>
<p><strong>3 quotes of Icahn</strong>
</p>
<p><em>„When most investors, including the pros, all agree on something, they're usually wrong.“</em>
</p>
<p><em>" When nobody wants something, that creates an opportunity.“</em>
</p>
<p><em>" In life and business, there are two cardinal sins. The first is to act precipitously without thought and the second is to not act at all.“</em>

<Title>XAG/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.30%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.37%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.67%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.62%.</strong>
 Friday´s return was <strong>-1.04%</strong>
, which is below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently negative (<strong>-1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-3</strong>
 for price indexation. It means that we are in the early negative phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. The <strong>XAG/USD</strong>
  has risen above the short-term moving average in recent weeks. In the medium and long term, however, MAs still support bearish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/211031_Mo_M_7bea4710e2.jpg" alt="XAG/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, there have been more declining trends, with a maximum of <strong>3</strong>
 consecutive days. The total maximum for the downtrend for the last <strong>3</strong>
 years is <strong>8</strong>
 days. Upward trends have not exceeded more than <strong>3</strong>
 consecutive days in recent months. The total maximum for the last <strong>3</strong>
 years is <strong>5</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>2.80%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>1.60%</strong>
, which is below average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.00%</strong>
 and <strong>3.00%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>5.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to a slight bullish development in recent weeks. In addition, it was very important for bulls to rebound upwards from the demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>38.20%</strong>
 and the short-term moving average. However, the divergence between price development and the RSI could motivate bears to take power. In the case of further growth, additional resistance for the bulls could be the psychological level of <strong>25.00</strong>
 or the long-term moving average together with the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 and the psychological level of <strong>26.00</strong>
.</p>

<Excerpt>Rising inflation around the world could motivate bulls in precious metals. However, if global stock markets fall, we may also see a correlated decline in metals. The current price of XAG/USD - Silver Spot US Dollar is 23.85 (October 29, 2021). So let’s move on to statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>German DAX advances toward all-time highs</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Monday has been a bullish day so far for EU equity indices, despite some weakness in US benchmarks. US indices were down slightly at the time of writing, but the German DAX was trading half a percent higher, rising above 15,800 EUR.</p>
<h2>Focus on German and US data</h2>
<p>Earlier today, <strong>German retail sales weakened notably, printing -0.9% year-on-year in September</strong>
, down from 0.4% previously. The monthly change dropped to -2.5%, from 1.1% scored in August. Both numbers came out well below expectations.</p>
<p>From other news, the <strong>US ISM manufacturing PMI for October slid marginally to 60.8, down from 61.1</strong>
. However, it remains well above the critical 50.0 threshold. In addition, the inflation subindex, priced paid, jumped to record highs of 85.7, up from 81.2 previously, while the employment subindex also increased from 50.2 to 52.0.</p>
<p>It looks like <strong>the ECB would not start tightening monetary policy anytime soon</strong>
, and rates might stay at the current harmful levels forever as the central bank continues to downplay the inflation spike as temporary.</p>
<p>From other news, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Monday that they expect China to fulfill the trade deal commitments. The current inflation surge is a result of supply bottlenecks, higher energy prices. Inflation should ease in 2H 2022, she continued.</p>
<h2>Daily chart looks bullish</h2>
<p>On Friday, the <strong>DAX index posted a nice bullish pin bar as the price retested its 50-day moving average and bounced higher</strong>
. That was a strong bullish signal, sending prices higher today. Additionally, it might have confirmed the medium-term uptrend.</p>
<p>The next target for bulls is expected in the 15,800 – 16,000 EUR zone, where the current cycle highs are.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the support could be found at 15,700 EUR, followed by Friday’s lows and the 50-day average at around 15,550 EUR.</p>

<Title>Aussie craters after dovish RBA decision</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian dollar was the weakest major currency Tuesday as traders sent it sharply lower after the latest Reserve Bank of Australia monetary policy decision. At the time of writing, the AUD/USD pair was down 1.2%, changing hands at around 0.7430.</p>
<h2>Dovish RBA undermines the Australian dollar</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, the Australian central bank left monetary policy unchanged, and the primary rate was kept at 0.1%, as widely expected. Following the decision, Governor Phillip Lowe held a press conference, <strong>presenting the dovish bias of the central bank</strong>
. Below are some of his most important remarks.</p>
<p>Inflation has picked up, but in underlying terms is still low, at 2.1 percent. <strong>The RBA will not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2 to 3 percent target range. Market pricing for early rate hikes is extremely unlikely.</strong>
</p>
<p>Regarding the economic activity in Australia, <strong>the central forecast is for GDP growth of 3 percent over 2021 and 5½ percent and 2½ percent over the following two years.</strong>
</p>
<p>As for rising house prices, the <strong>RBA will not use interest rates to contain housing prices</strong>
. However, borrowers need to be aware that loan rates will rise one day.</p>
<p>Don't have an inflation problem in Australia, Lowe concluded.</p>
<h2>Falling commodity prices hinder the Aussie further</h2>
<p>Tuesday has been a somewhat bearish day for commodities, damaging the Australian dollar further. During the US session, oil was down 1% to trade near 83 USD, silver plunged 2.5% to 23.40 USD, gold traded below 1,790 USD, and copper fell 1% to 4.34 USD.</p>
<p>It looks like the recent rally has been stopped by the 200-day moving average, currently near 0.7550. <strong>On a shorter time frame, a double top formation has formed.</strong>
 The neckline of the formation at 0.7460 has been broken down already. Therefore, the short-term outlook has changed to bearish.</p>
<p>As long as the Aussie trades below the first resistance of 0.7460, rallies could be sold. The next target for bears will likely be at previous highs and lows near 0.7380, still not representing the full 90 pips potential of the double top pattern.</p>
<p>Alternatively, should the Australian dollar jump back above 0.7450, the recent correction might be over. The medium-term uptrend would likely resume in that scenario, targeting the 200-day average and current cycle highs at 0.7550.</p>

<Title>GBP/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.42%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.43%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.21%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.21%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was only <strong>-0.40%</strong>
, which is still below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-2</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that the periodic change is in the neutral stage and the indexation is in the declining phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to all MAs, <strong>GBP/USD</strong>
 is currently in a bearish sentiment after the exchange rate has fallen below the monthly moving average.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, more upward trends have been recorded, although the currency pair is on a declining trend. A maximum of <strong>3</strong>
 consecutive days was reached. However, downward trends in the same period did not exceed <strong>2</strong>
 days. The maximum in the measured period is <strong>8</strong>
 days in the downtrend and <strong>9</strong>
 days in the uptrend. To estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions, we could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.75%</strong>
). The current value is <strong>0.38%</strong>
, which is below average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.0%</strong>
 and <strong>1.0%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<p>Basic technical analysis supported short-term bullish sentiment last month. However, the exchange rate was hampered at an important level of resistance at <strong>1.3800</strong>
 and the long-term moving average. In addition, the divergence between price development and the RSI has recently motivated short-term bears. <strong>GBP/USD</strong>
 has also recently approached the demand zone (green rectangle) with a strong bottom, where is the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
.</p>

<Excerpt>BOE Governor Andrew Bailey is speaking in Glasgow today. However, the most important event of the day will be the FOMC Press Conference. The current price of the GBP/USD exchange rate is 1.3655 (November 03, 2021). This pair is still in the important medium-term zone. Therefore, we will now look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>Be aware of crypto scams - a case study of Squid Game token</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What happened with the Squid Game?</h2>
<p>Squid Game (SQUID) was a token that was clearly inspired by incredibly successful Korean Netflix series Squid Game, in which players were eliminated through different games to find the winner. This mini series was so popular, that some “experts” in the cryptocurrency world wanted to have a piece of the cake for themselves and created a Squid Game (SQUID) token.</p>
<p>Although the token was not anyhow affiliated with the producers of the mini series as per Netflix claims, it rose by over 130 000 % in less than a week. This rise was extremely impressive even for the cryptocurrency world, although it was very clear from the start that there is something fishy about this project. On Monday, when it reached the price of 2 800 dollars, rising from less than 0.07 dollars, the project was rugged, leaving all the investors empty-handed. What happened and how can investors make sure that they do not invest in the likes scams of Squid Game ever again? Here are some tips.</p>
<h2>Few helpful tips for avoiding crypto scams</h2>
<h3>1. Countless red flags</h3>
<p>While it is not always the best decision to be extremely cautious and not take any risks, in the world of cryptocurrencies one has to always double or triple check everything before investing. With Squid Game token there were countless red flags that needed to be addressed and frankly that showed, this was a scam. Even the official website of CoinMarketCap had included this kind of disclaimer on its website for Squid Game token:</p>
<span class="quote-author">“We have received multiple reports that the website and social are no longer functional & users are not able to sell this token in Pancakeswap. There is growing evidence that this project has rugged. Please do your own due diligence and exercise extreme caution. This project, while clearly inspired by the Netflix show of the same name, is NOT affiliated with the official IP.”
</span>
<span class="post-quote">coinmarketcap.com</span>
<h3>2. No team and terrible social media</h3>
<p>As the disclaimer from the CMC showed, there was no easy access to find any reliable information about the team. And while this worked in case of Bitcoin, not many projects in todays cryptocurrency world can go without functioning team or social media behind it.</p>
<p>For instance, the official Telegram group of the token, which had around 90 000 followers only served for the purpose of the scammers to spread the information around, while the users could not contribute to the debate. There was also no possible way of contacting the core team and get answers, since even the “official” Twitter account had comment section disabled. Moreover, the accounts were banned many times, leading to the creators of this scam to running several different Twitter accounts.</p>
<h3>3. Questionable website and whitepaper</h3>
<p>The token had also a whitepaper, which in cryptocurrency world is a more than common occurrence. The team usually uses the whitepaper to communicate the vision of the project, its goals and problems it solves, as well as shows the tokenomics and technology behind the idea. In many cases it is the most important document that the team has to release and therefore the standards for whitepaper writing are pretty high.</p>
<p>However, in the case of Squid Game token the whitepaper was clearly missing a lot. There were many grammatical errors, unofficial and unverifiable claims. One of them for instance stated, that the official token has been sold in one second on 20th of October in some mysterious presale. The same goes for website. The design as well as usability and structure were more than suspicious.</p>
<h3>4. Anti-dump mechanism</h3>
<p>If all the above mentioned red flags are not enough for the investor, this last one should probably be the most important one. The token had an “anti-dump mechanism” embedded in the code, which simply put, means that the owners of the cryptocurrency cannot sell the tokens. That means that once you buy it, there is no way for you to get rid of it, even if it makes profits of tens of thousands, which was the case for Squid Game. While the idea behind this might be to stop whales from manipulating the price, in this case it stopped people from realizing the profits and showed that this token was never truly meant to be a cryptocurrency.</p>

<h2>Sad story with happy ending?</h2>
<p>The combination of several major red flags should be more than enough to discourage anyone to put capital into projects such as this one. Cryptocurrency world is full of great ideas and solid teams that are trying to build something bigger. But the case of Squid Game was not one of the.</p>
<p>On the 1st of November, the token was rugged, leading to the loss of 99 % of its value. The creators used their own backdoors in the code to run away with all the funds trapped inside the liquidity pools (approximately 2 million dollars), leading to a drop from 2 860 dollars to the current levels of 0.015 dollars. For investors in this project it is definitely a sad story. However, it can teach many of us an easy lesson on how to avoid scams in the cryptocurrency industry by looking for different red flags.</p>

<Excerpt>Cryptocurrency world has always been a place where hackers, fraudsters and criminals had easy access to a broad audience of naïve newcomers. Although it might feel that sometimes it is difficult to spot a fraud or a scam in the pool of cryptocurrencies, this was not the case for Squid Game (SQUID).</Excerpt>

<Title>EUR/USD weakens after dovish Lagarde & robust US data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The EUR/USD pair slid Wednesday and dropped toward last week’s lows at 1.1550, undermined by the recent Lagarde comments and surprisingly strong US data.</p>
<p>The EU calendar brought only the Eurozone unemployment rate for September, which ticked lower a notch to 7.4%, down from 7.5% previously.</p>
<h2>(Forever) Dovish Lagarde</h2>
<p>Traders paid attention to Christine Lagarde’s speech, who said that <strong>despite the current inflation surge, the outlook for inflation over the medium term remains subdued.</strong>
 Therefore, even after the expected end of the pandemic emergency, it will still be important that monetary policy – including the appropriate calibration of asset purchases – supports the recovery and the sustainable return of inflation.</p>
<p>It looks like everybody sees inflation everywhere, yet the central banks remain oblivious to rising prices in every sector of the economy. The Fed keeps the same rhetoric, although the US central bank is expected to start tapering its asset purchases this month.</p>
<h2>US data helping greenback</h2>
<p>From the US macro calendar, <strong>the ADP employment change for October surprised on the upside and printed 571,000</strong>
, above expectations of 400,000. The previous month was revised lower from 568,000 to 523,000.</p>
<span class="quote-author">The labor market showed renewed momentum last month, with a jump from the third quarter average of 385,000 monthly jobs added, marking nearly 5 million job gains this year,</span>
<span class="post-quote">said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP</span>
<p>Additionally, the <strong>ISM's Services survey soared to 66.7, rising to a new record high and smashing expectations of 62.0</strong>
. It was also well above the 61.9 scored in September.</p>
<p>Services print is back above the Manufacturing print. The divergence is evident between Services activity (improving) and Manufacturing output (weakening). Additionally, in response to a further rise in costs, firms raised their selling prices at the fastest rate on record.</p>
<span class="quote-author">While the service sector is seeing a waning impact from the pandemic, it’s a different story in manufacturing, where the supply crisis continues to cause havoc and dampen production growth. Supply delays worsened in October, which has in turn fed through to a further intensification of inflationary pressures,</span>
<span class="post-quote">Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit said.</span>
<p>The daily chart looks choppy and without a clear trend, with <strong>the medium-term descending trend intact as long as the pair trades below 1.1660</strong>
. Significant support is in the 1.1530 - 1.1560 area, and if the euro drops to new lows, the downtrend could be confirmed, targeting the 1.15 threshold.</p>

<Title>GBP/USD Slides Ahead of BoE Decision</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The greenback quickly recovered from yesterday's post FOMC selling, and the dollar index was down notably, pushing the GBP/USD pair half a percent lower. At the time of writing, it was seen at around 1.3630, falling toward the critical support of 1.36.</p>
<h2>Will BoE surprise?</h2>
<p>The day's main event is the Bank of England monetary policy decision, due at 13:00 CET. The official consensus is for everything to remain the same, with the primary rate expected to stay at 0.1%.
<strong>Analysts think that 3 out of 9 MPC members will vote for a rate hike</strong>
, which is insufficient for the BoE to raise rates.</p>
<p>However, according to the economists at Bank of America (BofA), the Bank of England will raise the benchmark interest rate by 15 basis points (bps) today.</p>
<span class="quote-author">We expect a 6-3 BoE vote to hike Bank Rate 15bps. We also think that BoE forecasts and communication are consistent with fewer/slower rate hikes than the market prices. With the market now fully priced for a 15bp rate hike, the risks are obviously skewed towards disappointment and a GBP sell-off,</span>
<span class="post-quote">they added.</span>
<h2>Latest FOMC decision</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, <strong>the FOMC announced that tapering begins in mid-November with a 10 billion USD drop in Treasurys and 5 billion USD in Mortgage-Backed Securities</strong>
, then declining by 15 billion USD every month.</p>
<p>Despite no mentions of incoming rate hikes, <strong>the market has turned even more hawkish, implying more than two rate hikes by the end of next year</strong>
 and pulling forward the first rate-hike expectations to June from September.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the bond market is also pricing a policy error as <strong>short-term yields continue to rise, but long-term yields seem to have peaked</strong>
. Therefore, the yield curve is collapsing and flattening notably, usually indicating an incoming recession.</p>
<p>Later in the day, investors will focus on the usual Thursday's jobless claims, expected to improve slightly. Additionally, unit labor costs for the third quarter are due, forecast to soar sharply to 5.2%, up from 1.3% previously.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, the 1.36 zone could once again serve as crucial support. Larger stop losses could be hit if the Pound drops below it, potentially sending the pair toward September lows near 1.3450.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the resistance is found at yesterday's highs at 1.37, and if not defended, sterling might advance toward 1.38 again.</p>

<Title>What did the latest FED meeting show?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Quantitative easing and the “printing of money”</h2>
<p>One of the most important topics of the FED meeting was the quantitative easing (known as QE). After the dump in March 2020 the “printers” of FED have started to work harder than ever before, leading to creation of more than 120 billions of dollars per month.</p>
<p>This decision was seen in the markets, since it was the biggest stimulation that the world has ever seen. Yet, during that time, it was clear why FED made this decision. Economy was slowing down and had to recover from sharp shocks due to pandemic. Thus, FED had no other choice than to react. However, since the moment, when the World Health Organisation (WHO) official claimed Covid-19 a pandemic, a year and a half have passed. The whole world got almost back to normal, yet, Fed is still printing 120 billion dollars a month. Therefore, many people wondered, when will this stop or at least slow down.</p>
<p>FED obviously cannot stop the QE suddenly, but rather has to “surprise the markets with few small shocks.” Yesterday, we have seen the first “shock decision” from the FED, since it decided to lower the monthly asset purchases by 15 billion dollars to 105 billion. However, since this number is still excessively huge, this message was perceived as positive for the markets. If the decrease was about to be much higher, the markets could descent into chaos, which is something that FED knows very well, and decided to play it safe.</p>
<p>When it comes to the interest rates, there have not been any major news regarding this topic. The interest rates will therefore remain the same. However, for the next year, we can expect interest rates to be increased at least partially as a reaction to the inflationary pressures. It is only a matter of time till FED starts with sharper decreases in QE and rate hikes.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I believe that this meeting went fairly well and the markets are not somehow dramatically affected by it. As of now, I do not see any reason for panic or chaos that would need to spread around the markets. It is probable that the markets will continue rising. However, tampering of QE and interest rate hikes can be expected probably in the upcoming year. Yet, nobody really knows the true fitness of the economy, which is a reason why any decision of FED needs to be very cautions.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Federal Reserve (FED) is a central bank of United States. It is logical that the decisions of FED have market-moving power and it is therefore important to follow the claims and statements of this central bank. Many people focused on yesterdays´ meeting since people believed that it was important due to numerous reasons. What actually happened?</Excerpt>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Getting ready for an ATH?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What does the theory say?</h2>
<p>In the world of cryptocurrencies, but also in the trading world itself, the following tends to be true. If the chart consolidates under strong resistance or ATH, the longer it stays below this level, the higher the chance for a breakout. Why is that true? Simply because if we are at the levels of resistance and the sellers are not able to push the price lower, it is only a matter of time before the stronger buyers push the price over the resistance.</p>
<p>We also have to count in the whales, which are accumulating the long positions and that can take some time. Thus, the longer it takes for the breakout to happen, the higher the chance that it will happen sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>In December 2020 it took us some time as well to break the previous ATH. After the ATH was broken, it took almost 20 days for consolidation to end and for major breakout to happen to new, significantly higher, ATH levels.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Previous ATH of Bitcoin</span>
<h2>Current situation</h2>
<p>Currently I believe that unless we fall below the level of around 56 456 USD, there is a huge chance that we can soon see new ATH. The first target that I would be watching is 70 128 USD, with the next one of around 79 450 USD. Once we overcome the ATH with a strong breakout, then we can get to “price discovery” stage and see a rather significant upward movement, such as the one on Tesla right now.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin 1D chart</span>
<h2>4h chart</h2>
<p>Looking at shorter timeframe, we can see a strong support, which I do not believe that will be invalidated in coming days. On contrary, more indicators and on-chain data point to the end of consolidation period and strong breakout leg.</p>

<Excerpt>Bitcoin made an ATH only two weeks ago, but it did not last long before the biggest cryptocurrency fell. Right now, nothing spectacularly important is happening with Bitcoin, and we can mostly see a sideways movement. What does that mean for the traders?</Excerpt>

<Title>Crude Oil (WTI) statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.76%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.95%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.91%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.93%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>3.12%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently negative (<strong>-1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-1</strong>
 for price indexation. Therefore, it is currently in a slightly negative phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated development of cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/211108_Cycles_a0ec07f312.jpg" alt="WTI daily price indexation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. As we can see in the chart below, all <strong>WTI</strong>
 MAs currently support bullish sentiment. In the event of a decline, the monthly MA may be the price support.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/211108_Mo_M_808c0572dc.jpg" alt="WTI daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, there have been stronger upward trends with a maximum level of <strong>4</strong>
 consecutive days. The maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>8</strong>
 days. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>2</strong>
 days in the same period. However, the maximum decrease was <strong>11</strong>
 days in the measured period. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.11%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.85%</strong>
, which is slightly below the average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.60%</strong>
 and <strong>3.60%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>6.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to positive sentiment this year, as the market price is creating higher highs and higher lows. The last uptrend leg rose by more than <strong>20 USD</strong>
 after a rebound from the demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the psychological level of <strong>60.00</strong>
. However, there is a bearish divergence between price development and the RSI that has developed in recent months. The psychological level of <strong>77.00</strong>
 along with the short-term MA could be an important support if the market price falls lower.</p>

<Excerpt>The current price of Crude Oil (WTI) is 82.40 (November 08, 2021). The first reaction of the WTI price after the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) supported the decision of OPEC to ease cuts by 400 thousand in December was a decline. However, the price is again above 80 USD. Let us, therefore, look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>French CAC seems unstoppable</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The French CAC equity index is up eight days in a row, rising to fresh all-time highs above the psychological level of 7,000 EUR. On Monday, it was up 0.2% at the time of writing, being the strongest of the EU major indices.</p>
<h2>Macro data remain optimistic</h2>
<p>On Friday, traders paid attention to the US labor market update. <strong>October nonfarm payrolls increased by 531,000 jobs, and data for September was revised higher to show 312,000 jobs created</strong>
 instead of the previously reported 194,000. Nevertheless, both the USD dollar and US yields fell after the numbers.</p>
<p>Earlier in the session, the EU Sentix investor confidence rose to 18.3 for November but failed to reach the estimate of 18.6. The previous number was revised to 16.9.</p>
<h2>Central banks speakers still helping stocks</h2>
<p>Additionally, the European Central Bank (ECB) Chief Economist, Philip Lane, said that the current period of inflation is very unusual and temporary. Moreover, <strong>we believe there are strong reasons for inflation to fall next year</strong>
, he added. Lastly, Lane concluded that the ECB would ensure Europe has a strong recovery and that an unnecessary adjustment of financing costs does not derail it.</p>
<p>His remarks were a bit dovish as everything points to the fact that <strong>the ECB will not raise rates anytime soon, especially when they think inflation will come down next year</strong>
. The CAC surged to new highs after his comments.</p>
<p>Later in the day, several FOMC members will have speeches, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who will deliver opening remarks at an online conference on gender and the economy, virtually hosted by the Federal Reserve Board. Since the topic is not monetary policy, it might not cause market volatility.</p>
<h2>Charts look bullish</h2>
<p><strong>There are two crucial supports for the CAC index at the moment</strong>
 - one at the psychological level of 7,000 EUR and the other at previous highs near 6,900 EUR. As long as the index trades above them, all three outlooks remain bullish, and dips are expected to be bought.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it is now challenging to find any resistance since the index has never been here. Therefore, <strong>traders might watch for any unusual price formations indicating a possible price reversal</strong>
.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin breaking ATH - great times ahead or should we be cautious?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Over 98 000 dollars by the end of the month?</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has broken the ATH today. It has done so yet again. The latest ATH was created only few days ago and it is probable that the next one is only few hours/days again. Many analysts and crypto enthusiasts are very optimistic about the last two months of the year 2021. In fact, the Q4 has been warmly expected by most of the cryptocurrency projects and the whole infrastructure, since many people believed it according to several models, this was supposed to be the time that the real bullrun really exploded.</p>
<p>One of the models that saw the prices of Bitcoin explode was the Stock-to-Flow model by PlanB. This pseudoanonymous creator of the S2F model has been extremely bullish about the price of Bitcoin. In fact, in July he stated that he believes that by the end of August, the price of Bitcoin will be over 47 000 dollars, by the end of September above 43 000 dollars and by the end of October over 63 000 dollars. And while the Octobers´ prediction was not hit (October closed at around 61 500 dollars) it is important to note that PlanB made these predictions from the S2F, when the prices were around 35 000 dollars. Moreover, the predictions of August and September were spot on.</p>
<p>And what does the model predict for November? According to PlanB, if everything goes as the Stock-to-Flow model forecasts, the price of Bitcoin by the end of this month should be trading above 98 000 dollars. Moreover, by the end of December the price can be above 135 000 dollars. That means that there is a chance that Bitcoin can more than double in less than two months. Well everyone still needs to be careful.</p>
<h2>Not celebrating just yet</h2>
<p>Fractals, models, historical price charts and many more. In recent days, you might see many other arguments by crypto enthusiasts as to why Bitcoin should be sharply growing in the upcoming weeks. And even though it might be true, there are always two sides to a coin. In this world that means that you should not only focus on the growing potential of Bitcoin (which there is for sure), but also be ready for the sideways movements or declines. In this sector, just as with any financial sector, no one can know where the prices of any assets will go.</p>
<p>Therefore, even though it looks like there is only one way to go from here now, you have to always take into account the other options. Moreover, we have seen in many cases that cryptocurrency world does exactly the opposite of what is expected of it. And since everyone is expected Bitcoin and all the altcoins to go up, this sector can once again surprise.</p>
<p>There are not many indicators that would indicate that the cryptocurrency world can go down from here, but you can never rule out that option. For instance, the volumes with which the Bitcoin broke its ATH was not very significant, meaning that it might have only been a minor break after which the price will consolidate again.</p>
<p>Thus, as always, be very careful when entering any position, especially in cryptocurrency world. Bitcoin can be in the “price discovery stage” where the huge jumps can happen, the fact is that increased volatility can be seen, which can always surprise the newcomers.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Bitcoin broke its ATH yet again. This is definitely very optimistic for the supporters of the cryptocurrency world, but even though it looks that there are great times ahead, one still needs to remain vigilant.</Excerpt>

<Title>EUR/GBP fails at 200-day average again</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The euro-sterling cross ticked lower today, as the EUR/USD pair was flat, but the GBP/USD pair managed to book some gains. At the time of writing, the euro was seen at around 0.8530 against the Pound.</p>
<h2>EU sentiment is rising</h2>
<p>Traders paid attention to today’s ZEW surveys, which surprised positively. <strong>German economic sentiment jumped to 31.7 in November, up from 22.3 in October</strong>
, while analysts had expected a decline to 19. Likewise, the eurozone’s economic sentiment survey improved to 25.9, from 21 previously. However, there was no volatile reaction to the data.</p>
<span class="quote-author">Financial market experts are more optimistic about the coming six months. For Q1 2022, experts expect growth to pick up again and inflation to fall both in Germany and the Eurozone,</span>
<span class="post-quote">the survey said</span>
<p>From other news, the European Central Bank (ECB) top supervisor <strong>Andrea Enria said on Tuesday that low ECB interest rates are now hurting bank margins more than they are boosting lending volumes.</strong>
 He added that the margin effect has been prevailing, so there is a negative effect on bank margins, but this is likely to persist for a while.</p>
<p>Additionally, ECB President Christine Lagarde is due to deliver opening remarks at the ECB Forum on Banking Supervision. However, since the topic of her speech is not monetary policy, her comments will likely be ignored by market participants.</p>
<p>Investors will then switch attention to the US PPI indices. According to this measure, <strong>inflation is expected to rise further to 8.7% year on year</strong>
. However, the core indicator is seen stalling at 6.8%. As a result, the USD might be volatile after the data, likely moving the GBP/USD and EUR/USD pairs, impacting the EUR/GBP cross as well.</p>
<p>More critical US data will be released tomorrow, including the US CPI data. Inflation will likely stay near the previous levels, way above the Fed’s 2% target.</p>
<h2>Daily chart remains bearish</h2>
<p><strong>The EUR/GBP cross has been stuck below the 200-day moving average since the start of 2021</strong>
. It managed to jump to the average in September, but bears quickly defended it and sent the euro to new cycle lows.</p>
<p>The same pattern seems to be repeating nowadays as the euro re-tested the 200-day average at 0.8580, only to form a bearish daily pin bar, usually a reversal pattern. Two days of selling have followed, bringing the cross lower. <strong>If the price can not climb back above the 0,8580 zone in the following days, we might see another leg more down, targeting 0.8475</strong>
.</p>
<p>Alternatively, more significant stop losses could be hit if the euro climbs above the 200-day average, potentially sending the cross toward another strong resistance at 0.8610.</p>

<Title>AUD/USD drops to one-month lows after Chinese inflation numbers</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian dollar traded lower today and dropped to fresh one-month lows below 0.7360 as sentiment remains negative for the Aussie after the recent dovish RBA decision.</p>
<h2>Chinese & US Inflation in focus</h2>
<p>During the Asian session, China's National Bureau of Statistics reported that in October, CPI rose 1.5% year-on-year, higher than the 1.4% expected and up from 0.7% scored in September.</p>
<p>At the same time, <strong>Chinese PPI rocketed to 13.5%, well above the consensus of 12.4%. That is the fastest pace since records began in November 1995.</strong>
</p>
<p>Later in the day, <strong>the US CPI for October is due, and traders forecast inflation to stall at 5.3%</strong>
 using this measure, while the core inflation will likely stay unchanged at 4.0%.</p>
<p>Additionally, Thursday's jobless claims will be released today because of bank holiday tomorrow.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, US data showed that the** producer price inflation (PPI) came in at 8.6% and the core rate at 6.8%,** nearly twice as high as at any time in the last ten years, and more than three times the Fed's 2% inflation goal.</p>
<p>Lately, a couple of Fed’s governors reiterated investors that the Fed wouldn’t hurry to raise rates. However, <strong>St. Louis Fed President James Bullard took a more hawkish view, calling for  two rate hikes in 2022.</strong>
</p>
<p>"If inflation is more persistent than we are saying right now, then I think we may have to take a little sooner action in order to keep inflation under control," Bullard said Monday in an interview on Fox Business Network.</p>
<h2>Weak Aussie to persist?</h2>
<p>The <strong>Aussie was hit by the recent dovish stance of the RBA</strong>
 as traders started to price in incoming rate hikes, only to be disappointed by the central bank. As a result, the market is mispricing any rate hikes soon, and the case for raising rates would not be met until late 2023.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Aussie failed to capitalize on the soaring commodity prices, as precious metals and oil rose sharply. Therefore, the bearish pressure could continue in the following days.</p>
<p>Since the Australian dollar dropped below solid support of 0.7400, **the short-term outlook now appears bearish. **The next target for bears could be at previous lows in the 0.7320 region. Another demand zone could be at the medium-term ascending trend line, currently near 0.7250.</p>
<p>Alternatively, <strong>the Aussie needs to climb back above 0.74 to cancel the immediate bearish threat.</strong>
 In that case, bulls could push the pair to0.7470 as the next target.</p>

<Title>GBP/AUD advances after UK, Australia econ data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The GBP/AUD cross rose half a percent during the London session, last seen trading at around 1.8350 and trying to settle above its 200-day moving average.</p>
<h2>Australian data disappoint</h2>
<p><strong>The Australian employment change improved to -46,300 in October, up from -138,000 previously</strong>
, but it was much worse than 50,000 new jobs created. The unemployment rate worsened drastically to 5.2%, up from 4.6%. It looks like the COVID restrictions and never-ending lockdowns and surveillance are hurting the economy more than expected.</p>
<span class="quote-author">The softer than expected employment report for October supports the RBA’s latest guidance that it is still not planning to begin rate hikes until at least 2023 at the earliest. We still believe that risks remain skewed to the downside for the Australian dollar, </span>
<span class="post-quote">economists at MUFG Bank said in a note today.</span>
<h2>UK data also miss forecasts</h2>
<p><strong>The UK GDP for the third quarter declined to 6.6% annualized, down from 23.6% in the second quarter</strong>
 and weaker than the 6.8% forecast by economists. The quarterly GDP change slowed to 1.3% from 5.5% in Q2.</p>
<p>Additionally, **industrial production for September fell to -0.4% from 0.8%, and manufacturing production slowed to just 0.1%, down from 0.5% previously. **</p>
<span class="quote-author">A slowing macro environment and relatively contained inflation expectations point towards a less aggressive rate cycle. The Bank of England failed to pull the rate trigger in November. Instead, we expect rates to be hiked by 15bps in February, reversing the March 2020 emergency cut,</span>
<span class="post-quote">Economists at CIBC Capital Markets noted on Thursday.</span>
<h2>US inflation coming in hot</h2>
<p>From other news, the <strong>US Consumer Price Index (CPI) jumped 6.2% from a year ago, the most since 1990</strong>
. The monthly increase was 0.9%. Both were above analysts’ estimates.</p>
<p>The <strong>core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 4.6% year-over-year, also the most in more than 30 years.</strong>
 The rise from September was 0.6%. The dollar strengthened notably after the release, sending the dollar index above 95.0 for the first time since July 2020.</p>
<p>However, the AUD/USD pair continued to decline today after weaker-than-expected domestic labor market data. In contrast, the GBP/USD pair traded marginally higher, resulting in a bullish day for the GBP/AUD cross.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the Pound dropped to fresh yearly lows against the dollar as the GBP/USD pair fell below 1.34. However, as long as it remains below 1.36, the medium-term downtrend remains intact, targeting 1.32.</p>

<Title>Gold settles above 1,850 USD</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The bullion has had a perfect week as it was up every day, except today, as traders took some profits from the recent rally. Gold went from 1,760 USD after the taper announcement to 1,860 USD yesterday.</p>
<p>Both gold and silver advanced despite the USD rising to fresh multi-month highs, sending the EURUSD pair below 1.15 for the first time since July 2020.</p>
<h2>Divergence between Fed and ECB</h2>
<p>Additionally, <strong>short-term rate-futures markets continued to adjust hawkishly, with 2.5 rate-hikes now priced-in by the end of 2022</strong>
. As a result, the two-year US yield rocketed to 0.55%, implying a further rise in short-term rates. Still, <strong>real yields (nominal yields - inflation) dropped to new lows</strong>
 as inflation (expectations) continued to march higher, therefore boosting the precious metals.</p>
<p>On the other hand, interest rates in the EU bloc will probably remain negative for the foreseeable future as European Central Bank President <strong>Christine Lagarde said last week that higher interest rates next year were improbable.</strong>
</p>
<p>The latest Reuters poll of economists showed that Eurozone inflation will continue to march higher, consistently overshooting European Central Bank’s (ECB) 2% price target next year.</p>
<p>Later in the day, traders will focus on <strong>Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for November, expected to improve marginally from 71.7 to 72.4</strong>
. In addition, JOLTS job openings will also be released, potentially causing some volatility in the markets.</p>
<h2>Daily chart seems bullish</h2>
<p><strong>The bullion managed to jump above the critical resistance of 1,830 USD</strong>
, killing massive stop-losses of short positions above that level. Further squeeze sent the metal above 1,860 USD.</p>
<p>Considering the overbought conditions, the metal will likely retest the 1,830 USD zone, now the major support. If bulls manage to defend it, the medium-term uptrend might be renewed.</p>
<p>Should the bullish momentum persist, <strong>the next target is expected at this week’s highs near 1,865 USD, followed by the significant resistance at the psychological threshold of 1,900 USD.</strong>
</p>
<p>Alternatively, if gold fails to stay above 1,830 USD, we could see a quick decline toward the 200-day moving average at 1,795 USD.</p>

<Title>Quidel Corporation (QDEL) - basic stock analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>2.92%</strong>
 and <strong>-2.69%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>1.35%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.23%</strong>
. Yesterday’s return was only <strong>6.59%</strong>
, which is between the first and second standard deviation. Our scoring is currently negative (<strong>-2)</strong>
 for the month-on-month change and <strong>-1</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the middle of a negative short-term phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. As we can see in the chart below, only long-term MA is currently in a bearish sentiment. Shorter MAs could support the market price.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Our estimated Earnings Power Value (EPV) is <strong>182 USD</strong>
 and the Growth Value (GV) is approximately the same. The potential opportunity for growth is based on the value of EPV and % of reinvested earnings. NAV is represented by the Total Stockholders' equity. The following chart uses the value from the last fiscal year.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>5.24%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>5.67%</strong>
, which is close to the average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-6.00%</strong>
 and <strong>6.00%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>10.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to a medium-term upward trend, as the market price creates higher highs and higher lows. Currently, it has also rebounded from the uptrend line (blue line). Since its peak in 2020, the market price has fallen by <strong>66%</strong>
 and almost reached the psychological level of <strong>100 USD</strong>
. According to our estimate of intrinsic value, the market price is currently well below the negative (<strong>230 USD</strong>
 – red highlight) scenario. For bulls, the supply zone (red rectangle) could be critical, where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
. Staying above the moving averages will be very important for positive sentiment.</p>

<Title>Can gold and silver aim for new ATHs? </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Gold</h2>
<p>Gold created its ATH exactly 460 days ago. Most of the movements since then were downwards or side movements and it mostly looks like gold has created one giant triangle. This does not have a bad connotation at all, since gold was mostly rising before that. Last weeks were more problematic since the inflation in United States rose to 6.2 % levels. EU is not “far behind.”</p>
<p>Indices, stocks and cryptocurrencies were mostly rising, but gold has mostly stagnated. Yet, from the technical point of view, this week was crucial, since gold has broken the 1 830 level. It created a new higher high and broke upwards the trendline. Right now, there is nothing that should stop gold from reaching new ATH.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/10_Komodity_gold_bd63e7a4cb.png" alt="Gold 1D chart ">
<span class="img-caption">Gold 1D chart</span>
<h2>Silver</h2>
<p>It is interesting to see that silver, “the younger brother” of gold, has broken the trendline as well, but much sooner. However, silver did not have any major movements in the past year and it mostly moved sideways. The first goal for silver would be to get above 30 USD. Yet, silver is still far from its ATH, but the fact that the inflation is rising can push this metal to the levels never seen before.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Silver 1D chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Most of the precious metals have jumped back quite quickly after the 2020 dump, however, after the stock market have started rising again, most of the precious metals were only moving to the side. Due to increasing inflation, most of the commodities might be back on track to rise and I believe that this week has been crucial for the change from sideways movement to rising movement.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: The support is holding us – wait for the reaction!</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Support is close</h2>
<p>Very strong support is really close. This is the level between 62 565 – 63 309 USD. Between these two price points, Bitcoin has to see a bounce upwards. We have already touched this level with one of the wicks on the Wednesday evening, but as it is usual with Bitcoin, it jumped right back up. But right now we can see a slow decrease to those levels again.</p>
<p>We are very close to those levels, which can again be a reactive zone. Moreover, below this level we have one more strong support in the form of the trendline, which in the ideal case, we need to hold. This is the most probable scenario right now and before any continuation I need to see how Bitcoin reacts at those levels in the upcoming hours. If it does, next levels should be around 70 233 USD.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin 4h chart </span>
<h2>Has something changed on daily chart?</h2>
<p>The daily chart has not even shown any crucial downtrend. The chart looks stable for now. The problems could arise once Bitcoin breaks down below 56 380 USD. But it does not look like that should happen any time soon.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin 1D chart</span>
<h2>Ethereum not looking good</h2>
<p>To be honest, Ethereum does not look good. Here we can see almost perfect rising wedge, which in some situations could lead to the uptrend, but most of the time it leads to a decrease. So far, ETH is still holding the trendline, but the increasing pressure from the sellers side can be easily spotted. Currently the situation is stable, but I am expecting the price to fall back down to 4 380 USD.</p>

<Title>AUD/JPY bounces after Chinese data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The AUD/JPY cross has enjoyed positive sentiment Monday and was trading half a percent higher during the London session, last seen at around 83.90.</p>
<p>Investors bought the Australian dollar after the latest batch of Chinese data, which surprised to the upside.</p>
<h2>Chinese data spur demand for Aussie</h2>
<p><strong>Chinese retail sales rose to 4.9% year-on-year in October, up from 4.4% in September</strong>
 and well above the 3.5% expected by analysts. In addition, <strong>industrial production climbed to 3.5%, from 3.1% previously</strong>
, also above 3.0% expected. Lastly, fixed asset investment declined from 7.3% to 6.1%.</p>
<p>Following the release of the October activity numbers, China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released a statement, via Reuters, expressing their take on the economy:</p>
<strong>China's economy maintained a steady recovery in October</strong>
<li>.</li>
<li>Expects China’s economy to continue to recover, consumer inflation to remain mild.</li>
<li>Expects infrastructure investment to pick up as China rolls out key projects.</li>
<li>China's employment situation gradually improving</li>
<p>Several macroeconomic indicators were released by Japan too, but it looks like they did not cause any volatility in the JPY.</p>
<p>Japanese industrial production stayed at -2.3% YoY in September, while <strong>capacity utilization worsened notably to -7.3% from 3.9% previously.</strong>
</p>
<p>Later in the session, traders will pay attention to the <strong>New York Empire State Manufacturing Index for November, seen improving slightly to 21.60 from 19.80 in October.</strong>
</p>
<p>The Australian dollar remains supported by the rising commodity prices as precious metals jumped to multi-month highs. At the same time, the WTI oil trades at 80 USD a barrel, the highest level since 2014.</p>
<h2>Daily chart remains bullish</h2>
<p>The Australian dollar declined recently, but that was to be expected, following the sharp rise since October. Nevertheless, the Aussie managed to defend the 200-day moving average below 83.00, therefore, the medium-term outlook still remains bullish.</p>
<p>The next target for bulls could be at 84.70, followed by the current cycle highs in the 86 region. <strong>The Australian dollar needs to close above 86 to confirm the long-term uptrend</strong>
. In that case, we might see a rally toward the psychological 90 handle.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the support is at the mentioned 200-day moving average at around 82.80 (blue line on the chart), followed by another demand zone at previous lows near 82.25.</p>

<Title>GBP/USD ticks higher after Labor market data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The greenback eased today, pushing the GBP/USD pair nearly half a percent higher during the London session. At the time of writing, the pair was changing hands at around 1.3450, slightly bouncing back from the fresh one-year lows printed in the last week.</p>
<h2>UK jobs market data in focus</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) informed that <strong>the unemployment rate improved to 4.3% in September, down from 4.5% previously</strong>
. At the same time, the claimant count change rose to -14,900 from -51,000 in September.</p>
<p>Additionally, the number of workers on payrolls rose 0.6%, or 160,000, between September and October to 29.3m.</p>
<span class="quote-author">It might take a few months to see the full impact of furlough coming to an end, as people who lost their jobs at the end of September could still be receiving redundancy pay. However, October's early estimate shows the number of people on the payroll rose strongly on the month and stands well above its pre-pandemic level.
</span>
<span class="post-quote">Sam Beckett, ONS head of economic statistics, said.</span>
<p>Robust employment data boosts the case for the Bank of England (BoE) to hike rates in December. However, markets are still priced for another rate hike in February, which might be relatively hawkish and currently uncomfortable for the BoE.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Fed is projected to start raising rates by July 2022, and the market is pricing nearly three rate hikes in 2022 as inflation continues to soar.</p>
<h2>US data under scrutiny</h2>
<p>Later in the day, the <strong>US retail sales will be released, and market participants expect a modest improvement there</strong>
. However, <strong>both the ex-auto and control group indicators are seen sliding</strong>
, possibly undermining the US dollar.</p>
<p>Additionally, the US industrial production and capacity utilization numbers will be published. Lastly, several FOMC governors will speak today, likely causing volatility in the markets.</p>
<h2>Short-term chart looks bullish</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, sterling managed to get back above previous lows at 1.3415 as stop-losses were destroyed below that level. <strong>If it closes today above 1.3415, it could be a bullish reversal signal,</strong>
 targeting the critical resistance at 1.36.</p>
<p><strong>It needs to climb above 1.36 to cancel the medium-term downtrend.</strong>
</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the selling pressure reappears, the intraday support stands at 1.3415, while the swing support is at last week’s lows of 1.3350. A breakdown below it would likely send the Pound further lower toward 1.30.</p>

<Title>XPD/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.48%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.53%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.75%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.71%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was <strong>0.21%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>2</strong>
 for price indexation. It is currently in a slightly positive phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. The <strong>XPD/USD</strong>
 rose again above the short-term MA this week. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, only medium and long-term MAs currently support bearish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/211117_Mo_M_bebae85825.jpg" alt="XPD/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, we have witnessed more rising trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>3</strong>
 consecutive days. The maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>14</strong>
 days. The downward trends have not exceeded more than <strong>1</strong>
 day in the last period. However, the maximum in the measured period is <strong>6</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>2.95%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.81%</strong>
, which is well below average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.0%</strong>
 and <strong>3.0%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>5.25%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to a short-term uptrend, as the market price creates higher highs and higher lows. However, it is approaching a very important psychological level at <strong>2 200</strong>
, which could act as resistance to the market price. In addition, slightly higher, there is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50.00%</strong>
. The current positive development was supported at the demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>78.60%</strong>
. The divergence between price developments and the RSI created in late September and early October also motivated the bulls.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Taproot upgrade has been activated</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>History of Taproot</h2>
<p>Taproot is the name for the newest actualisation of the Bitcoin network. It was introduced by Gregory Maxwell at the end of January 2018 and ever since then, huge bulk of Bitcoin core developers has been working on it.</p>
<p>In June 2021, the developers have finally brought the version of Taproot that was tested and included various upgrades, which we will talk about in a bit. Yet, the consensus of the whole network was needed, for which a mechanism of “Speedy Trial” was used. Speedy Trial is simply a method, during which miners signal their preparedness for the upcoming upgrade in the mined blocks. If the consensus of the network is above 90 %, the upgrade will be locked in and activated in due time.</p>
<p>And that is exactly what happened with Taproot. The miners signalled their preparedness with over 90 % of the blocks, leading to Taproot activation with the block number 709 632, which was mined on Saturday. What does that mean for Bitcoin?</p>
<h2>What is Taproot?</h2>
<p>Taproot is a soft fork of the whole network, which helps with numerous improvements of Bitcoin. Most notably it should help with lower transaction fees, higher speed of  transactions, better smart contract programmability or improved privacy. How does Taproot achieve all of that?</p>
<p>It does so by introduction of two major concepts. First one is MAST (Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree) which is a rather complicated technological concept that mostly deals with hashing. This improvement however helps with privacy and smart contract programmability on top of Bitcoin network. Simply said, MAST helps with the efficiency and privacy of the smart contracts.</p>
<p>The second and probably even more crucial improvement is the introduction of Schnorr signatures to Bitcoin. Allegedly this is something that even Satoshi Nakamoto was planning to do, however, at that time there were problems with patenting rights which should be a reason why he deviated from this idea. Yet, Schnorr signatures are introduced to Bitcoin now thanks to Taproot and their impact should be mostly seen on different Layer-2 solutions such as Lightning Network or Liquid.</p>
<p>Schnorr signatures should primarly help with complex transactions. These can be for instance different multisigs (multi signature transactions) or opening and closing of Lightning Network channels. In case of Schnorr signatures, all of these transactions will be perceived by the network as simple transactions, essentially improving the privacy. Moreover, since they will be mostly dealt with as simple transactions, the transaction costs will be lowered and the speed of transactions should increase as well.</p>
<h2>The story does not end here</h2>
<p>The overall effect of Taproot should thus be mostly improvement of the privacy as well as scalability and usability of the whole network. Yet, many core developers have pointed out that while the Taproot activation is a great success, the real benefits will be only seen once that platforms/wallets/protocols will be building on the Taproot soft fork. Until then, Taproot is merely a minor adjustment.</p>

<Excerpt>Bitcoin has just undergone one of the most important upgrades in its history. Taproot is the most significant improvement of the Bitcoin network since SegWit in 2017. What does Taproot bring to the table?</Excerpt>

<Title>FTSE down four consecutive days, undermined by inflation data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The British FTSE 100 index, also known as the Footsie, has been underperforming other European indices as the ECB will keep monetary policy loose for the following year. Still, the BoE will likely deliver its first rate hike this year.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the FTSE 100 index was down four days in a row, trading near 7,300 GBP ahead of the US session.</p>
<h2>UK inflation continues to climb</h2>
<p>Earlier today, the Office for National Statistics informed that <strong>consumer price inflation (CPI) rose to 4.2% in October from 3.1% the month before</strong>
, climbing to the highest level in a decade as energy and fuel costs increased. Analysts had expected inflation to rise only to 3.9%. The CPI inflation is now two times the Bank of England's 2% target.</p>
<p>The ONS said the "main upward pressure" came from electricity, gas, and other fuels after the energy cap was increased by 12% in October. Restaurants and hotels, education, furniture, household goods, and food and non-alcoholic beverages also contributed.</p>
<p><strong>Core CPI inflation - excluded of volatile elements such as food and fuel - jumped to 3.4% in October from 2.9% previously</strong>
, much higher than 3.1% anticipated by market participants.</p>
<span class="quote-author">Inflation rose steeply in October to its highest rate in nearly a decade. Increased household energy bills drove this due to the price cap hike, a rise in second-hand cars and fuel costs, and higher prices in restaurants and hotels,</span>
<span class="post-quote">ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said.</span>
<p><strong>Everything looks set for the Bank of England to raise rates at its next meeting in December.</strong>

<a href="https://investro.com/forex/gbp-usd-ticks-higher-after-labor-market-data">Tuesday’s splendid UK job market numbers</a>
 also helped the narrative of hiking rates. However, it looks like the market is currently priced for more rate hikes in 2022 than the BoE will likely deliver.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Pound remained close to its one-year lows against the greenback. However, a possible reversal is forming as the pair is trying to close above previous lows of 1.3415.</p>
<p>Should we see a rally in the GBP/USD pair, it might undermine the Footsie index further as those two are usually negatively correlated to each other.</p>
<p>Later in the day, <strong>several FOMC governors are due to speak, possibly influencing the US markets but likely moving the FTSE index as wel</strong>
l, especially if they sound overly hawkish.</p>
<p>The key support level now lies in the 7,270-7,280 GBP region, where previous highs are converged with the short-term uptrend line from September and October lows. If the index drops below that support, the medium-term outlook could change to bearish.</p>

<Title>USD/CAD back in the 1.25 region amid USD strength</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The Canadian dollar, also known as the Loonie, traded flat against the greenback on Thursday, last spotted at 1.26.</p>
<p>The USD/CAD pair rose from 1.23 in the middle of October to the current levels, <strong>boosted by the soaring USD</strong>
 (as traders priced in more rate hikes in 2022) **and falling oil prices **(as the WTI benchmark posted a multiple top pattern at 85 USD and dropped below 78 USD today)</p>
<h2>Canadian data in focus</h2>
<p>Despite the Canadian ADP report surpassing market expectations, today’s data failed to move the USD/CAD pair. According to this metric, the domestic economy created 65,800 new jobs in October, up from 41,000 in September.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, <strong>the core CPI inflation in Canada ticked higher to 3.8%, up from 3.7% previously</strong>
, against expectations of a decline to 3.5%.</p>
<p>Headline <strong>CPI inflation did accelerate to 4.7%, from 4.4% previously</strong>
. It keeps pressure on the Bank of Canada to continue normalizing policy after bringing QE to an end last month. The BoC has brought forward plans for the first-rate hike to Q2 2022, and risks are skewed in favor of an even earlier hike next year.</p>
<p>Therefore, economists at MUFG Bank expect recent Canadian dollar weakness to prove short-lived.</p>
<p>Economists at ING share the same view. They believe that <strong>the bright outlook of the Canadian economy is set to fuel the Canadian dollar.</strong>
</p>
<span class="quote-author">In Canada, the jobs market is at pre-pandemic levels. Record-level investments keep supporting the growth outlook. A very successful vaccination campaign allows a loosening of the so-far stringent border policy. The domestic economic story is set to remain positive for CAD and partly shield it from any risk-off waves or USD appreciation, </span>
<span class="post-quote">They said regarding the Canadian dollar.</span>
<p>In the US, jobless claims printed 268,000, down from 269,000 previously but above the 260,000 expected. Continuing claims improved notably to 2.08 million. Additionally, the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Survey jumped to 39 in November, well above 23.8 scored in October.</p>
<p>The next resistance is seen at 1.27, while the critical selling area is expected near the summer tops in the 1.28 zone. Bears must defend this area. Otherwise, the medium-term trend could change to bullish, targeting 1.30.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the support could be at 1.25, where the pair stopped this week. While above it, the short-term outlook seems bullish.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: Which levels to follow and when it can all go wrong?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>The 56 000 dollars level</h2>
<p>I saw this level as one of the strongest supports even before we have started the decline. Why? Because it tells us how “strong” Bitcoin is, since the last low wick of a daily close was at this level. If we close below this level, that would immediately few signals. First one would be showing that the market is now not strong enough to go up. Second would be showing us that bears are so powerful that they can break this level.</p>
<p>The whole dynamics of the short term growth potential would change, however, this would not probably constitute the beginning of the bear market. We can breach this level during the day, but the daily close has to stay above this price level.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin 1D chart</span>
<h2>Short term outlook</h2>
<p>Looking at the 4H chart, we can see that we have decent resistance above. It is the MA21 and the previous low, which are forming a resistance between 58 408 – 59 281 dollar levels. I personally believe that for the few upcoming days Bitcoin can have a problem with these levels. Yet, the most important thing anyways is to close above 56 000 dollars, which can boost the price increase in the coming days.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin 4h chart</span>
<h2>What is my personal view?</h2>
<p>Since we are in the cryptocurrency world and the 56 000 dollars mark seems to be the most crucial level now, it is obvious that we will be trading below this level for some time. This would only be to trigger the stop losses and maybe a liquidity cascade a bit. Yet, this is pretty common. Still, it is important not to close below this level. What I liked was the fact that during the last night the altcoins did not bleed out more than Bitcoin, which can be a signal of a relative overall strength in the market. But if I look at the altcoins separately, most of them are at decisive levels as well, but unless they break them down, it is all still bullish. However, if some Top coins close below the important levels, it can end up pretty bad.</p>

<Title>Looking at DXY and S&P 500 - where are we going? </Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>DXY</h2>
<p>This index shows the strength of the dollar. In general, if this index goes up, the direct impact of this can be seen in two different settings:</p>
<p>1.US dollar is increasing in the Forex pairs.
2.Equities and indices tend to fall (not all the time).</p>
<p>What is the situation now? Currently we are very close to the resistance, where I believe the current upward movement will end. I am looking at the levels 96.34 – 96.47. I believe that the change of the trend can come somewhere around these numbers and can be followed by downwards movement. It can even be a TOP of the overall structure.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/13_DXY_1_D_be87b4799d.png" alt="1D chart of DXY">
<span class="img-caption">DXY 1D chart</span>
<h2>S&P 500</h2>
<p>Looking at this index, we can see that we are in an ascending triangle. This is usually followed by a price increase. Yet, we are not currently rising with a strong sentiment. If we however combine the information with what DXY says, I think that S&0P 500 will finally break the upward resistance right at the moment when DXY descends to correction. This would make a lot of sense and also might be what the whales are waiting for.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I believe that S&P 500 will go the opposite way compared to DXY, meaning that it should rise. S&P 500 even tried to do so this morning, however, this was rejected. Breaking the resistance is, however, in my view only a matter of time.</p>

<Title>EUR/USD craters to 16-month lows after dovish Lagarde comments</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The euro fell one percent against the dollar, dropping below 1.1270 for the first time since July 2020 as the shared currency will likely have the worst inflation problems out of the major currencies.</p>
<h2>Inflation to stay and not temporary</h2>
<p>Earlier in the session, data showed that <strong>German PPI inflation rocketed to 18.4% year-over-year, up from 14.2% previously</strong>
. Moreover, the monthly change rose to 3.8% from 2.3% in September.</p>
<p>Additionally, the French unemployment rate worsened to 8.1% from 8.0% previously, against expectations of improvement to 7.8%.</p>
<p>Traders paid attention to the ECB’s head Cristine Lagarde speech, who once again **reiterated that the conditions to raise rates are very unlikely to be satisfied next year **(despite nearly 20% PPI inflation in Germany).</p>
<p>Moreover, even after the expected end of the pandemic emergency, it will still be necessary for monetary policy – including the appropriate calibration of asset purchases – to support the recovery and the sustainable return of inflation.</p>
<p>Inflation drivers are to fade over the medium term. As positive demand forces gain strength, the inflation outlook will be better than before the pandemic. (yes, that is very appealing for people, to pay 20% or more for everything, job well done).</p>
<p>Therefore, the ECB remains the most dovish out of the major central banks, undermining the euro across the board.</p>
<h2>New round of lockdowns</h2>
<p>From other news, <strong>Austria reimposed a complete lockdown for both vaccinated and unvaccinated people for at least ten days</strong>
 (we have heard that before). Germany may follow. Also, starting From February 1st, everyone will be legally required to have been vaccinated. Austrian authorities also said they would make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory, vowing “penalties” for those who continue to resist.</p>
<p>It looks like <strong>another round of lockdowns is due in Europe for the third or fourth time this year.</strong>
 Sentiment notably worsened after this news, and stocks declined to session lows, undermining the euro further.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the euro will probably retest June 2020 lows at around 1.1170, with the next bearish target at the psychological level of 1.10.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the single currency needs to climb above 1.14 to cancel the immediate bearish threat. Until then, rallies are expected to be sold, and bears remain in control.</p>

<Title>Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC) - basic stock analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.27%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.23%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.63%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.57%</strong>
. Yesterday’s return was only <strong>0.49%</strong>
, which is below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the extreme of a negative short-term phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated cycles development based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. As we can see in the chart below, only long-term MA is currently in a bullish sentiment. Shorter MAs could be a resistance to market price.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Our estimated Earnings Power Value (EPV) is <strong>321 USD</strong>
 and the Growth Value (GV) is approximately <strong>413 USD</strong>
. The potential opportunity for growth is based on the value of EPV and % of reinvested earnings. NAV is represented by the Total Stockholders' equity. The following chart uses the value from the last fiscal year.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.78%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.15%</strong>
, which is close to the average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-2.40%</strong>
 and <strong>3.00%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to a dynamic decline in the market price at the end of October. However, it is still in an important demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>38.20%</strong>
, along with a long-term moving average. According to our estimate of intrinsic value, the market price is currently very close to the negative (<strong>343 USD</strong>
 – red highlight) scenario. In addition, slightly lower, there is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50.00%</strong>
. Higher volumes on Thursday could motivate the bulls.</p>

<Title>Gold falls to previous highs; bulls must reappear to defend the uptrend</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The bullion fell 0.3% Monday, dropping toward the critical 1,830 USD support zone, where the previous massive resistance zone used to be. Bulls need to defend this area for gold to stay in an uptrend.</p>
<h2>Fed getting more hawkish</h2>
<p>Last week, the <strong>Fed’s Governor Christopher Waller called for an accelerated QE taper and said that rate increases could be appropriate as soon as Q2 2022.</strong>
 Shortly after that, influential **Vice Chairman of the FOMC Richard Clarida said it could be appropriate to discuss an accelerated QE taper in December. **</p>
<p>Additionally, the Fed’s Bullard called for at least two rate hikes in 2022. Finally, several FOMC members will speak this week, possibly reiterating the hawkish mood.</p>
<p>The <strong>Fed funds futures indicate the Fed first rate hike should come  July 2022, and the following rate increase is expected by November 2022</strong>
. So by then, the QE should be long over.</p>
<p>Moreover, <strong>US yields continue to climb, with the two-year yield rising to the current cycle highs at 0.55%</strong>
, while the ten-year yield returned to 1.6% today.</p>
<p>The USD has been sensitive to the hawkish shift in monetary policy. As a result, the dollar index jumped to 96.00, the highest level since July 2020, sending the EURUSD pair below 1.13. Gold and silver usually have a hard time in such an environment, although the actual inflationary fears still support both metals.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, traders will pay attention to the US GDP data for the third quarter. Furthermore, <strong>the Fed’s minutes from the latest decision will be released, possibly reinforcing the hawkish narrative.</strong>
</p>
<h2>Significant technical levels on the daily chart</h2>
<p>As previously mentioned, gold must defend the 1,830 USD threshold. Otherwise, the risk of a more extensive correction can’t be ruled out, targeting the 200-day moving average at 1,800 USD. Additionally, the short-term ascending trend line is also there.</p>
<p>The MACD indicator is about to send a bearish signal from an elevated level, usually leading to a decline in prices over the following days.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the support is defended, we could see a quick rally, targeting the current cycle highs at around 1,865 USD. Gold must close above that level on a daily basis to confirm the medium-term uptrend, with the next level to watch at 1,900 USD.</p>

<Title>USD/JPY nears five-year highs amid rising US yields</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The US dollar continued in its bullish trend Tuesday, sending the USD/JPY pair above the 115 threshold for the first time since March 2017.</p>
<p>On Monday, <strong>the White House & Joe Biden nominated Fed Chairman Powell for a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve</strong>
. Lael Brainard will be vice-chair of the Fed, taking the reins from Richard Clarida, the current vice-chairman, whose time on the board of governors is set to expire in January. Clarida decided to file for resignation in October after allegations of insider trading.</p>
<p>The WH statement read: We can't just return to where we were before the pandemic, we need to build our economy back better, and I'm confident that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard's focus on keeping inflation low, prices stable, and delivering full employment will make our economy more robust than ever before.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the <strong>US inflation is at 30-year highs (with the core CPI above 4% and regular CPI above 6% yearly) and shows no signs of easing</strong>
. Well, for some people, it still may be considered as "low inflation and stable prices."</p>
<h2>US yields shot higher, supporting the USD</h2>
<p><strong>The decision was taken hawkishly as investors perceived Lael Brainard more-dovishly</strong>
, sending the two-year yield to new cycle highs above 0.6% and shifting the market's expectations for a first rate-hike from July 2022 to June 2022. The market is currently pricing in nearly three full rate hikes in 2022.</p>
<p>The one thing is what the market expects; the other thing is what the Fed will actually do. Usually, it is the same, but even a slightly different hiking schedule could derail the current rally in the greenback.</p>
<p>From other news, the <strong>Japanese government announced on Friday that the Cabinet approved a new fiscal stimulus package with spending worth 55.7 trillion JPY</strong>
. They expect that Japan spending under the stimulus package will likely boost GDP by around 5.6% or 30 trillion yen, with most of the effect appearing in fiscal 2021, 2022.</p>
<p>Later today, the US PMI indices for November are due, expected to continue rising. Lastly, the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index is seen falling to 5 from 12 previously.</p>
<p>Should the dollar settle above 115, the long-term uptrend could bring the USD/JPY pair toward 118.00, where the bull market after Trump’s victory ended. That is the superior long-term resistance.</p>
<p>On the downside, the support is still seen near 114. As long as the greenback trades above it, the medium and short-term outlooks remain bullish.</p>

<Title>NZD/USD craters 1% after RBNZ decision; US data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, the Kiwi dropped to two-month lows, falling to the significant support of 0.6870 as sentiment notably worsened in the commodity-linked currencies.</p>
<h2>RBNZ decision taken negatively</h2>
<p>Earlier today, the <strong>Reserve Bank of New Zealand hiked the Official Cash Rate to 0.75% from 0.5%</strong>
, which had been widely expected. However, the following statement sounded dovish, and it looks like further rate hikes are not on the agenda soon.</p>
<p>The <strong>new RBNZ guidance now has the key policy rate at 2.10% by December 2022, a year sooner than the last estimate</strong>
. However, this is notably below what is currently priced into the financial markets.</p>
<span class="quote-author">The RBNZ is implying policy rate hikes of between 125-150bps by the end of next year and given New Zealand’s zero-COVID policy and the government today announcing the re-opening of borders from January, there are high risks of further disruptions ahead,</span>
<span class="post-quote">economists at MUFG Bank said Wednesday.</span>
<h2>Full US calendar</h2>
<p>Afterward, traders paid attention to the US Durable Goods Orders, which tumbled 0.5% month-on-month (versus +0.2% expected) in October and September's 0.3% monthly print was revised down to -0.4%.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the value of core capital goods orders, a proxy for business investment in equipment that excludes aircraft and military hardware, rose 0.6% after an upwardly revised 1.3% increase a month earlier.</p>
<p>Core capital goods shipments, a figure used to help calculate equipment investment in the government’s GDP report, increased 0.3% after jumping an upwardly 1.3% in the prior month.</p>
<p>From other news, today’s first revision of the USQ3 GDP data was 2.1%, below the 2.2% expected, if slightly better than the 2.0% initial estimate. In addition, personal consumption rose 1.7% annualized in 3Q after rising 12.0% the prior quarter.</p>
<p>Data also showed that the University Of Michigan's Sentiment rose from 66.8 preliminary to 67.4 final but remains well below the 71.7 in October. However,  <strong>consumers’ inflation expectations remained at their highest since 2008.</strong>
</p>
<p>Lastly, <strong>the Fed's favorite inflation indicator - Core PCE Deflator - jumped to its highest since 1991 to 4.1%, while the headline PCE rose 5.0% yearly</strong>
. That is more than twice the Fed’s 2% inflation goal.</p>
<p>The day will be finished with the FOMC minutes from the latest Fed's monetary policy meeting, where the central bank decided to start tapering its bond purchases.</p>

<Title>DAX loses 16,000 EUR threshold amid worsening sentiment</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>German DAX index was down six days in a row, dropping every day this week as traders took some profits from the recent impressive rally. At the time of writing, it was trading 0.15% weaker on Friday, dropping below the psychological 16,000 EUR mark.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the ECB meeting accounts from the central bank’s last meeting were released.</p>
<h2>ECB still ultra dovish</h2>
<p>The view was held that judging on the basis of the current developments, net purchases under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme could be expected to come to an end by March 2022, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was seen as likely that in <strong>the December 2021 Eurosystem staff projections the shorter-term inflation outlook for the euro area would once again be revised upwards</strong>

Lastly, At the current juncture, the accommodative monetary policy stance had to be reconfirmed & monetary policy had to be patient.</p>
<p>Investors also paid attention to the German GDP data. The year-on-year change was kept at 2.5% in the third quarter, while the quarterly change was revised slightly lower to 1.7%, down from 2% in the second quarter. In addition, the <strong>Gfk consumer confidence survey crashed to -1.6 in December, down from 1 in November.</strong>
</p>
<p>At the same time, <strong>German IFO fell for the 5th straight month to lowest level since February</strong>
. Considering another round of restrictions in Europe, the last quarter of the year will likely be economically weak.</p>
<p>The euro is down nearly 10% against the greenback in 2021, boosting European equities as there is usually a negative correlation between the euro and German stocks.</p>
<p>Additionally, the European Central Bank remains the most dovish major central bank, confirming several times it does not plan to raise rates in 2022. When compared with the Fed, the US central bank is now expected to raise rates three times in 2022.</p>
<p>The large divergence in monetary policies could keep pressure on the EURUSD pair, further boosting the price of EU stocks.</p>
<h2>Short-term looks bearish, long-term remains bullish</h2>
<p><strong>As long as the index trades below previous highs of 16,000 EUR, the immediate outlook seems bearish</strong>
, targeting yesterday’s lows at 15,775 EUR. From the medium-term perspective, the key support will be at the 200-day moving average at around 15,400 EUR.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the DAX jumps above 16,000 EUR again, we could see the continuation of the rally toward the current all-time highs near 16,250 EUR.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: BTC still indecisive</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Does the 4H chart provide answers?</h2>
<p>Looking at Bitcoin, the daily chart is rather obvious. We need to hold the 52 000 dollars threshold and the trendline. Everything important can be followed and seen on the 4H chart.
I believe that here we can see forming of a bottom, which is very typical of Bitcoin. In general, this is a structure that moves mostly sideways, but every important major movement up is quickly brought back down. Fundamental news is still rather negative, with very small impact of a positive sentiment.</p>
<p>Why are we seeing this type of a bottom forming? Probably due to whales. This type of investors needs this longer bottom formation to accumulate Bitcoin. Their biggest disadvantage is a huge amount of capital that they cannot put into the market all at once.</p>
<p>Having a look directly at the charts, yesterday we saw a first bullish movement in a few days. That however did not end well. Eventhough we have broken several resistances, we were not able to create a higher high, leading us back down. This is not surprising at all, since the market needs to gain strength again. With these movements the whales are also able to liquidate traders almost on daily basis.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin 4H chart </span>
<h2>Altcoins ready to follow</h2>
<p>As always, altcoins mostly follow the movement of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin is stagnating, altcoins could be moving sideways or upwards. However, once Bitcoin goes to correction, it is very probable that all altcoins will follow. In my view, altcoins are forming similar structures as Bitcoins – bottoms.</p>
<p>If we look at the capitalisation of the whole altcoin market, we can see it very clearly. Yesterday we were not able to go above the resistance. Yet, the alt capitalisation is creating higher lows and higher highs, which is a good sign for the future growth. But everything will be still mostly about the movements of the king – Bitcoin.</p>

<Title>Technical analysis of Facebook and Amazon stocks</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Amazon</h2>
<p>Looking at Amazon, I feel like this stock provides some solid opportunities for swing trading. Amazon has been stuck in the following channel for several months. The price touch of a lower bound is always followed by an upward movement, while the touch of the upper trendline is always rejected. We can also see that the chart reacted to the previous maximum and the break was rejected. I, however, believe that this is only temporary.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the channel will be broken some time in the future, but until then, traders can easily follow it and profit from it. And if the bull market in the equities continues, it is much more probable that breaking of the channel will be upwards.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Technical Analysis of Amazon</span>
<h2>Facebook</h2>
<p>Looking at the chart of Facebook, we see a very different situation. Even if we saw the bounce from the support, we cannot surely say that the correction is over. Yet, I believe that we can say that the 302 dollars level will be held and that Facebook will not be trading below this price.</p>
<p>As of now, more likely scenario is the upward break of the trendline and “attack” on the ATH. I can only see two possibilities of how this will pan out. First one is a direct break of the ATH. The other one is one more bounce from the trendline resistance and a movement down to form a double bottom and from there the new ATH should come. I still see the strength in this market, but I would enter the market only once it breaks the trendline or if it goes as low as the support level.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Technical Analysis of Facebook</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Today we looked at two technology stocks, but each of them is in different shape. But their main direction is up. Each downward movement can be now seen only as a correction. As of now there is no reason to believe that these stocks could go into bear market any time soon, which means that each of the corrections might be considered as an opportunity to buy.</p>

<Title>FTSE 100 collapses 3% as new COVID strain appears (again)</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Sentiment deteriorated sharply Friday, sending all risky assets aggressively lower. EU bourses declined 3-4%, with the FTSE index down to two-month lows, testing the 200-day average and trading at around 7,100 GBP.</p>
<h2>COVID news destroying longs</h2>
<p>Late Thursday, <strong>the World Health Organization announced that it's monitoring a new Covid-19 variant with "a large number of mutations," detected mainly in southern Africa. Moreover, it could be resistant to vaccines.</strong>
</p>
<p>The announcement caused a massive panic in the financial markets as it implies more lockdowns and restrictions are coming in the near future. Traders sold stocks, commodities and bought bonds and gold.</p>
<p>The UK has already suspended flights from six countries due to the new variant. As well as South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, and Botswana are all included in the new restrictions.</p>
<span class="quote-author">Inevitably this will dampen sentiment generally until such time as the strength of the variant can be assessed and, in the meantime, further pressure is likely to track shares in the likes of the airline and hospitality sectors. With the ‘new normal’ yet to be established post-pandemic, the theme will continue to run for some time yet,</span>
<span class="post-quote">Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said.</span>
<p>However, today’s “bad news” might prove only short-lived and quickly forgotten, with the dip-buying strategy still performing well as long as the long-term uptrend remains intact.</p>
<p>From other news, Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill said that a resurgence of the pandemic would mean that the bank would have to be more cautious. There are risks on two sides for the economy, he added.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <strong>on QE, Pill said that the idea that there would not be any run-off might be optimistic and he hoped any impact would be modest</strong>
. Moreover, Pill noted that he hoped the UK could return to having a positive real interest rate.</p>
<p>The macro calendar is empty today, offering no macro news throughout the rest of the day. The main focus of investors will remain on the new COVID variant and the bearish sentiment might continue in the following hours.</p>
<h2>Technical picture not so bullish anymore</h2>
<p><strong>The price has dropped to its 200-day moving average at around 7,040 GBP</strong>
, but so far, bulls have managed to defend it. As long as the index trades above it, the medium-term ascending trend is still valid.</p>
<p>In case of a bearish breakdown, the next target would likely be at 6,800 GBP, where the previous double bottom pattern is seen.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the mood improves and bulls reappear, we could see a rally toward 7,200 GBP. The index needs to climb above it to change the short-term outlook to bullish again.</p>

<Title>XPT/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.04%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.06%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.53%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.51%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>-4.18%</strong>
, which is almost the third standard deviation. It was a very negative day for this commodity. Our scoring is currently very negative (<strong>-3</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. Indexation is currently in the extreme of a declining phase of the cycle. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. As we can see in the chart below, all <strong>XPT/USD</strong>
 MAs currently support bearish sentiment. In the event of growth, monthly and 6-month MAs can be the price resistance.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, we have witnessed higher downward trends. They did not exceed <strong>5</strong>
 days. The total maximum in the measured period (last 3 years) is <strong>7</strong>
 days. Upward trends did not exceed more than <strong>4</strong>
 days in the same period. The total maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>6</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.20%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>4.02%</strong>
, which is above average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-2.40%</strong>
 and <strong>2.40%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>3.60%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this year, the basic technical analysis has supported bearish sentiment as the commodity price creates lower lows and lower highs. However, the market price is currently in an important area of the demand zone (green rectangle), where are the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50.00%</strong>
 and the psychological level of <strong>1 000.00</strong>
. In addition, there is a divergence between the price development and the RSI created since September. However, if the price falls below the zone, we can see new lows of the year.</p>

<Title>Oil trying to erase Friday’s huge losses</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The WTI benchmark bounced back Monday and was 5% higher ahead of the US session, jumping back above the important 70 USD threshold.</p>
<h2>Friday’s COVID crash</h2>
<p>Friday’s panic selling caused a 13% decline in oil price as the WTI plummeted 10 USD from 78 USD to 68 USD. Today’s 5% rally has so far erased only a third of that decline.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has designated the Omicron variant as a ‘variant of concern.’ Still, it has also stressed that there remains substantial uncertainty over the dangers it poses. Moreover, <strong>it looks like this virus strain will be even more transmissible than the Delta variant.</strong>
</p>
<p>However, <strong>South African researchers have also said it tended to trigger only mild infection, which could be good news</strong>
. Usually, when viruses mutate, they become more infectious but less dangerous or lethal.</p>
<p>Therefore, sentiment turned 180 degrees on Monday as investors reassessed the situation, and so far, the dip-buying strategy has proven profitable again.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>markets remain hopeful that OPEC and its allies (OPEC+) will pause its planned oil output increases in the wake of the new Omicron covid variant-led uncertainty</strong>
.</p>
<p>Later in the day, pending home sales for October are forecast to improve slightly, while the Dallas Fed Manufacturing Business Index will also be published. Currently, there is no consensus for the index.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is due to deliver opening remarks at a webinar hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York</strong>
. His comments will likely sound dovish, considering the recent sell-off in US stocks. He is expected to try and calm down the markets today, although the tightening of monetary policy should remain unimpacted.</p>
<h2>Daily chart looks neutral right now</h2>
<p>Oil plunged below the psychological level of 70 USD, where the 200-day moving average is also located. However, today’s rally has brought the price above 71 USD, changing the short-term outlook to bullish as long as the 70 USD is held.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <strong>the technical damage has been done, and many stop losses were destroyed in Friday’s crash.</strong>
 The daily and small time frame charts now look severely oversold, possibly leading to another rally.</p>
<p><strong>The next target for bulls will likely be in the 74 - 75 USD area</strong>
, where previous highs and lows are converged. However, oil needs to climb above 80 USD for the medium-term uptrend to become active again.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the critical support is seen at 70 USD, and if oil breaks below it again, we could see another leg lower, targeting August lows at 62.50 USD.</p>

<Title>DAX at two-month lows amid Omicron fears</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>German DAX index continued to decline today and was 2% weaker heading into the US session, trading at around 15,000 EUR, the level last seen in early October.</p>
<p>Panic returned to the markets Tuesday as Moderna chief Stephane Bancel suggested in a Financial Times article that existing Covid-19 vaccines would struggle to cope with the omicron variant, predicting a ‘material drop’ in their effectiveness. He also warned it would take months before pharmaceutical companies can manufacture new variant-specific jabs at scale.</p>
<p>From other news, <strong>the German unemployment rate improved a notch to 5.3% in November</strong>
, while the unemployment change ticked higher to -34,000 (from -39,000 previously).</p>
<p>Additionally, the <strong>European CPI inflation rate came out way above expectations of 3.7%, printing 4.9% year-on-year</strong>
. At the same time, the core inflation rate jumped to 2.6% from 2.0% in October. Nevertheless, the <strong>ECB has said several times it is doubtful that it would raise rates in 2022</strong>
, so inflation can continue to rise toward double digits.</p>
<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) Vice President Luis de Guindos said in an interview with Les Echos on Tuesday that <strong>he is confident that those net asset purchases will continue throughout next year.</strong>
 Beyond that, he doesn’t know. The dovish messaging is pretty apparent.</p>
<p>The euro also suffers on the FX market, being crushed by the USD to the lowest level since July 2020. The divergence in monetary policies remains in favor of the dollar. However, weaker euro is usually bullish for German stocks.</p>
<p>Later in the session, <strong>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify on the CARES Act before the Senate Banking Committee in Washington DC.</strong>
 His words usually bring volatility to the financial markets.</p>
<h2>DAX testing significant support but looks bearish</h2>
<p>The index retested the 200-day moving average today and yesterday (currently at 15,400 EUR), but it failed to breach above it, and bears sold the index. As long as it trades below that moving average, the medium-term outlook seems negative.</p>
<p>DAX is currently testing another major support at the psychological barrier of 15,000 EUR. If it drops below that level, the next target could be at October lows of 14,800 EUR.</p>
<p>Short-term time frames are now really oversold, implying a possible bounce from the mentioned significant support. <strong>The resistance is at the 200-day average at 15,400 EUR. DAX needs to close above it to ease the bearish pressure. Until then, the outlook appears bearish.</strong>

<Title>AUD/USD rallies after GDP data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian dollar was trying to recover from the recent sell-off. It was trading half a percent stronger on Wednesday, supported by the latest Australian GDP data and broad USD weakness.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <strong>Australian GDP surprised positively, printing 3.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, down from 9.5% previously, but above 3% expected</strong>
. The quarterly change dropped from 0.7% to a contraction of 1.9%, still better than the -2.7% forecast.</p>
<p>During the US session, the Markit US Manufacturing disappointed market participants, tumbling from 59.1 to 58.3 final for November, which is below October's final 58.4 - the weakest print since Dec 2020.</p>
<p>At the same time, the ISM US Manufacturing also disappointed, though only marginally, printing 61.1 versus 61.2 expected, but up from October's 60.8.</p>
<h2>Fed getting more hawkish</h2>
<p>More importantly, <strong>Jerome Powell testified before the Senate, saying that the “transitory view on inflation” is no longer valid and inflation will likely stay elevated</strong>
. Who could have seen that coming?</p>
<p>Additionally, he said that <strong>the Fed might speed up the current pace of tapering to end it sooner than the plan to finish QE by July 2022</strong>
. The greenback advanced after his remarks; however, considering the overbought sentiment, the rally faded quickly.</p>
<span class="quote-author">With Fed policy expectations in the driver’s seat, a fairly empty data calendar and uncertainty on the covid outlook likely to persist in the near-term, we think the path of least resistance in AUD/USD will likely remain further to the downside,</span>
<span class="post-quote">economists at Credit Suisse turned bearish on the Aussie and now target 0.7000 in AUD/USD.</span>
<h2>Aussie testing major support</h2>
<p>The Australian dollar has been undermined recently by the dovish RBA stance as the central bank reiterated that there would not be any rate hikes next year. Additionally, most industrial commodities have peaked - including iron ore, which is down 50% from its summer highs, copper, gold, silver, oil, etc. Therefore, downward trends in commodity prices usually lead to a decline in the Australian dollar as well.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the Aussie has managed to defend August lows at 0.71, and it looks like a slight bounce could occur from that level, considering the oversold conditions. As long as the support at 0.71 is intact, the short-term trend could be bullish.</p>
<p>However, the pair has dropped below the ascending trend line, ending the medium-term bull market. The target for the current bounce could be at September lows of 0.7170, and if the Aussie breaks above it, it might continue toward the mentioned trend line at 0.73, where previous lows and highs are also converged.</p>

<Title>Why are US indices dropping?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What is causing the drop?</h2>
<p>In my humble opinion, I believe that the current drop is caused by the chaos and uncertainty around the FED. We can see inflation rising almost anywhere in the world. FED is being bombarded by questions regarding the inflation almost every day. We have even mentioned this in previous articles in connection with different stimulus. Until now, they were as high 120 billion dollars a month. In November, FED decided to lower it by 15 billion dollars a month, to the current level of 105 billions. Yet, inflation is still rising not only in US, but also in Europe, which is a reason why Jerome Powell, Chairman of the FED, indicated that there might be more aggressive decisions announced in the near future from the FED.</p>
<p>Next meeting is planned on 15th of December, where the most expected topic will probably be decreasing the size of stimulus again, due to inflation fears. This might have caused the fear spreading around the markets, leading to the price drops.</p>
<p>With the current size of stimulus, it was expected that the whole "market support" might be ended around June or July next year. This can even be followed by increasing of the interest rates. However, if the size of stimulus would be decreased faster, the whole programme could end by the end of Q1 and the interest rate hikes could be expected during the summer. The upcoming meeting will thus be crucial for next few months.</p>
<h2>Reaction from S&P 500</h2>
<p>Looking at the markets, the fear is definitely present. Bonds are rising, gold is moving to the side and indices are falling. The uncertainty and uneasiness is definitely there. If we take a close look at S&P 500, we can see that this index is losing value. NASDAQ is in very similar situation.</p>
<p>As of now, it is crucial to be following the main supports and whether we see them broken or only tested. S&P 500 has been mostly reacting nicely to supports so far, but we would need to see some bullish upward movement or a break of a trendline or a new High to be sure.</p>

<span class="img-caption">1D chart of S&P 500</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This month is going to be very important for the markets mostly due to the FED meeting. If FED chooses a more hawkish approach and the size of stimulus would decrease, markets can react badly. Good news is that FED has announced this in advance, which means that the shock to the markets will not be so big and traders and investors can prepare accordingly.</p>

<Title>November close not optimistic for Bitcoin - where does that leave us?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Moonvember did not deliver</h2>
<p>After the Uptober, which was a creative name given to the October by the cryptocurrency community, many expected Moonvember – November with a huge movement upwards. This was for instance supported by Stock-to-Flow model, which predicted that the price of Bitcoin should close above 98 000 dollars by the end of November. And since all the previous predictions of S2F were correct, there was no reason to doubt the credibility of this course.</p>
<p>Yet, models are only right, until one day they are not. A common saying that describes the attitude that should have also been taken towards the S2F. This model proved right many times in history, and thus it was only a matter of time, when it will be broken. And that is what happened in November.</p>
<p>The monthly candle of November for Bitcoin not only did not deliver the “promised” 98 000 close. It even ended up in red numbers, with a monthly loss of about 7%. That was a bit surprising not only because the S2F model was invalidated, but also because November tends to be one of the most profitable months for Bitcoin. As represented by the table below, only February and October have more green closes than November (with April and July having the same amount – 3 red closes and 6 green ones).</p>

<span class="img-caption">Monthly returns of Bitcoin, Source: bybt.com</span>
<h2>Where to go from here?</h2>
<p>According to the S2F model, Bitcoin should have closed December above 135 000 dollars. As of now, that does not seem probable. The sentiment in the market is far from optimistic. This can be for instance interpreted by a common indicator in the cryptocurrency world, the Fear & Greed Index. This index represents the current atmosphere or sentiment in the market via measuring volatility, activity on social media, different trends in the market and other indicators.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/Fear_and_Greed_a99b49b1c8.png" alt="Fear & Greed Index">
<span class="img-caption">Current value of Fear & Greed Index, Source: alternative.me</span>
<p>As you can see, the current atmosphere represented by the index is Fear, which is at a value of 32. This is still not an “extreme fear,” which we have seen only few days ago with a value of 21, but it is fear nonetheless. And with this kind of sentiment, one can hardly expect the market to be rising. So unless something changes, December might not be the month for Bitcoin to go and “attack” the six-digits.</p>
<h2>Education and adding Satoshis</h2>
<p>That however does not mean that investors or traders should be down. Usually, during the times like these people spend more time on education or they try to understand different concepts or trends in the cryptocurrency world. Some topics that might be worth looking at right now are Metaverse, non-fungible tokens or Layer-2 payment solutions on Bitcoin like Lightning Network. Moreover, it never hurts to add more satoshis and a situation like this is a great chance to do so.</p>
<p>Additionally, even if it does not look the brightest now, it is also far from negative. The market sentiment is not at the same levels as is common for bear market and we have not dropped below any critical support, which still means that as of now, the bull market is intact. It might took longer than people initially believed, but that does not mean that it will not happen.</p>

<Excerpt>October was the most profitable month of this year and one of the best months in the last four years regarding Bitcoin returns. Almost 40 % increase during October was a great start to the previous quarter, and many expected the time has come for Bitcoin to break the 100 000 dollar barrier. But November made a stop to that.</Excerpt>

<Title>EUR/USD nears major resistance</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The EUR/USD pair moved higher Thursday, and it looks like the short-term bottom is in place at 1.12. The euro appears oversold, likely starting a corrective rally in the following days.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, <strong>European PPI inflation accelerated further to 21.9% year-on-year in October</strong>
, up from 16.1% in September. The monthly change nearly doubled to 5.4% from 2.8% previously. Additionally, the unemployment rate in the bloc improved a notch to 7.3%.</p>
<p>Later in the day, the usual Thursday's jobless claims are on the agenda, expected to rise notably.</p>
<h2>Macro situation favors USD over EUR</h2>
<p>There is still a significant divergence between monetary policies. <strong>The Fed is expected to raise rates in June 2022, while the tapering process could run faster, likely boosting the US dollar.</strong>
</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>the ECB has repeatedly said that it would not hike rates in 2022, undermining the euro.</strong>
</p>
<p>Big banks and asset managers are also somewhat divergent in their views and opinions on the pair.</p>
<p>Economists at Westpac expect EUR/USD to retest the 1.1200 level, if not the 1.1050/00 area, saying that this week’s weaker than expected German October retail sales underscores the potentially lower growth path for core Europe into 2022. Should Omicron concerns subside, relative growth and inflation profiles are biased to US and USD outperformance.</p>
<p>However, economists at MUFG Bank expect the euro to rebound modestly vs. the USD later in 2022 as the European Central Bank (ECB) could turn more hawkish next year.</p>
<span class="quote-author">The EUR will be well anchored through to end-Q1 2022. But beyond then, a more dovish Fed failing to deliver on expected rate hikes and building expectations of QE ending in the eurozone that could open up the prospect of ECB hikes in 2023 will allow EUR/USD to grind higher from current cheap levels slowly,</span>
<span class="post-quote">they added.</span>
<h2>Daily chart starting to look bullish</h2>
<p>The EUR/USD pair might have bottomed earlier in November, and bulls are trying to stage a corrective rally. <strong>The critical resistance is at the descending trend line, currently near 1.1350</strong>
. Once the euro jumps above it, we could see bullish momentum, targeting previous lows near 1.1520.</p>
<p>The MACD indicator has also sent a bullish signal from a profoundly negative zone, reinforcing the upward impetus. Therefore, as long as the euro trades above 1.12, traders might push the pair toward the mentioned 1.1520.</p>
<p><strong>A breakdown below the 1.12 support would likely send the shared currency toward the psychological level of 1.10.</strong>

<Title>EUR/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.44%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.44%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.22%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.21%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was <strong>-0.16%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>2</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>2</strong>
 for price indexation. That is, we are at the beginning of a growing phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/211202_Cycles_aa0ade4fc4.jpg" alt="EUR/USD daily price indexation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use <strong>3</strong>
 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to all MAs, <strong>EUR/USD</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment because it is below them. In the event of a rebound, the monthly MA may be exchange rate resistance.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/211202_Mo_M_ee8faad119.jpg" alt="EUR/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, there have been more declining trends, with a maximum of <strong>5</strong>
 consecutive days. This level has been tested several times in the last 3 years. Uptrends did not exceed more than <strong>2</strong>
 days. The maximum in the measured period is <strong>5</strong>
 days in a declining trend and <strong>7</strong>
 days in an uptrend. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>0.55%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>0.44%</strong>
, which is close to the average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.0%</strong>
 and <strong>1.0%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>1.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports bearish sentiment this year. However, we are currently witnessing a recovery in the exchange rate after falling into an important zone of demand (green rectangle), where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>61.80%</strong>
. In addition, we can see a bullish divergence between the market price and the RSI, which has been evolving since October. Volumes on positive days are also above average compared to previous months.</p>

<Excerpt>This week, the testimony of Jerome Powell caused higher volatility in major currency pairs, mainly due to the risk of Omicron and higher inflation. The current price of the EUR/USD exchange rate is 1.1330 (December 02, 2021). The currency pair is again in a critical support zone. Let us, therefore, look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: When can the next breakout be expected?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>How is the cryptoworld affected by the traditional markets?</h2>
<p>Yesterday, we have looked at the <a href="https://investro.com/stocks/indices-still-dropping">situation at FED</a>
 and what does that mean not only for inflation, but also for upcoming stimulus or indices. As one can imagine, such a big news have also an effect on cryptocurrencies. What effect one might ask? Well that you can see below.</p>
<h2>Reaction of Bitcoin</h2>
<p>At the first glance, nothing has changed for Bitcoin in past couple of days. We are still sitting below major resistances and above major supports. This simply means that we are still waiting patiently for major breakout to either direction. At this moment in time it is very hard to predict the direction of the movement, however, since we should still be in a bull market, the upward movement seem to be more probable.</p>
<p>That is also seen by the fact that Bitcoin has mostly tried to break the resistances, not the supports. Yet, all the tries has been rejected so far. You can see that in the chart below in the yellow circle. Coincidentally, this was also the time when we saw major downward movements also for indices and equities.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/17_Bitcoin_Friday_37e87c34dd.png" alt="Bitcoin 4h chart ">
<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin 4h chart</span>
<h2>What to expect now?</h2>
<p>Even if the situation might look unpleasant, I still believe that Bitcoin is looking bullish. This is for instance due to the fact that major indices have fallen sharply and some even broken important structures and patterns, but Bitcoin stayed above the main supports, still consolidating above the main trendline. Rule of a thumb also says that if something stays below the resistance for a long time, there is higher probability of an upward movement and a break of the given resistance.</p>
<p>Thus I expect Bitcoin to move upward in the next 7 days. The decision might even come as soon as weekend time. And since traditional markets are closed during weekends, Bitcoin can move without any other market affecting it, which might be good for the main cryptocurrency, since it would have the „freedom of movement.“</p>

<Title>GBP/USD plunges to one-year lows after US, UK data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The US dollar advanced Friday, sending other major currencies lower. At the time of writing, the GBP/USD pair was down more than half a percent, changing hands at around 1.3220, the lowest level since December 2020.</p>
<h2>US labor market sends mixed signals</h2>
<p>Today, data showed that <strong>the US economy created only 210,000 new jobs in November, the lowest number since December</strong>
. That was against expectations of 550,000 and down 336,000 from October’s 546,000.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>the unemployment rate improved to 4.2%, down from 4.6% in October</strong>
. At the same time, average hourly earnings stayed at 4.8% year-on-year (against expectations of 5.0%). The USD initially declined after the data, but losses were temporary. The dip was quickly bought, and it continued to strengthen.</p>
<p>After the labor market data, St Louis Fed President and FOMC voting member in 2022 James Bullard said on Friday that the US economy has been very good at adapting to the pandemic and that he thinks that will continue. Moreover, the danger is that we will get too much inflation, he added, and that is not the intent of the Fed's new framework.</p>
<p>Shortly after, <strong>the Services ISM surged to 69.1 for November, the highest ever, up from 66.7</strong>
 previously and against expectations of a decline to 65.0. The inflation subindex - prices paid - stayed near October’ 82.9, suggesting that inflation is not easing.</p>
<p>Sharper increases in manufacturing and service sector input prices led to the fastest rise in cost inflation on record. Alongside greater fuel and material costs, firms noted a steeper uptick in wage bills.</p>
<p>Rate hike expectations rose after today’s data, <strong>implying the Fed should taper faster and raise rates by June.</strong>
</p>
<p>As for the UK news, Bank of England (BOE) policymaker Michael Saunders said on Friday that a critical consideration for him at the December policy meeting would be the possible economic effects of the new Omicron variant.</p>
<span class="quote-author">Given Omicron has only been detected quite recently, there could be particular advantages in waiting to see more evidence,</span>
<span class="post-quote">he added.</span>
<p>The Bank of England is expected to hike rates at its December meeting amid soaring inflation in England. However, <strong>if the central bank decides to stay pat and not raise interest rates, we could see a sharp decline in the Pound value.</strong>
</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the UK Markit Services PMI revision brought it to 58.5 for November, somewhat below the previous number of 58.6.</p>

<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.76%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.77%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.40%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.36%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>0.85%</strong>
, which is below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently slightly negative (<strong>-1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
, which means that we estimate the extreme of the declining phase of the cycle. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to all MAs, <strong>XAU/USD</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment because it is below them. In the event of a rebound, 6-month and annual MAs may be a resistance to the market price.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, we have witnessed more upward trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>6</strong>
 consecutive days. However, the maximum increase was <strong>8</strong>
 days in the measured period. The downward trend in recent weeks have not exceeded more than <strong>5</strong>
 days. This is also the maximum for the last 3 years. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.36%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>1.20%</strong>
, which is almost average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.6%</strong>
 and <strong>1.6%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>2.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<p>Basic technical analysis still supports short-term bearish sentiment after November’s dynamic decline. <strong>XAU/USD</strong>
 is currently again very close to the support level of <strong>1 760</strong>
, where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50.00%</strong>
. The price is also below short-term and long-term moving averages. However, there is a divergence between price development and the RSI that could support bullish scenario. If it continues to decline, the demand zone (green rectangle), where are also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>61.80%</strong>
 and the psychological level of <strong>1 700</strong>
, could also provide more support for the bulls, as in March, early August and September.</p>

<Excerpt>If we see a global decline in the financial markets, gold could also fall in the first phase, as investors start to run for cash. Later, the price could rebound and rise. The current price of XAU/USD - Gold Spot US Dollar is 1 784 (December 05, 2021). Let’s now look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>DAX remains above critical support</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The German DAX index rose notably on Monday, trying to recover from the last week’s sell-off. At the time of writing, it was seen at around 15,300 EUR, still above the major psychological support of 15,000 EUR.</p>
<h2>Weak macro in EU</h2>
<p>Earlier today, the <strong>German factory orders cratered to -6.9% monthly in October, down from 1.3% in September</strong>
. The year-on-year change plummeted to -1%, down from 9.7% previously. Apparently, that was bullish for the DAX index, sending it half a percent higher.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <strong>EU Sentix Investor Confidence index dropped more than expected to 13.5 in December, down from 18.3 in November</strong>
, citing lockdowns as the primary driver of uncertainty in the region.</p>
<p>The index of current conditions dropped for the third month in a row to 13.3 from 23.5 previously, falling to its lowest since May. On the bright side, the expectations index jumped to 13.8 from 13.3 in November.</p>
<p>Sentix Managing Director Manfred Huebner said: "A slowdown and even a recession no longer seem to be ruled out now. These lockdowns hit the economy harder than before.”</p>
<p>From other news, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde came out on Saturday to speak about the economic and inflation outlook. She failed to say anything new, and the ECB still expects inflation to come down notably in 2022, despite the actual trend pointing to more substantial gains in inflation every month. <strong>The ECB remains the most dovish among the major central banks, possibly supporting the DAX index in the following months.</strong>
</p>
<h2>Daily chart remains bullish</h2>
<p><strong>As long as the DAX defends the key support of 15,000 EUR, the medium-term uptrend remains intact.</strong>
 However, the long-term bull market has ended as the index has not moved anywhere since April.</p>
<p>The short-term resistance seems to be at 15,600 EUR, and once the DAX is above it, we could see a continuation of the rally toward 16,000 EUR. However, the index must climb above 16,250 EUR to confirm the bullish bias, which right now seems like a challenging task.</p>
<p>Alternatively, should the support of 15,000 EUR fall, large stop-losses of long positions would be hit, likely resulting in a significant decline toward 14,100 EUR, where January/February 2021 highs are.</p>

<Excerpt>It looks like the recent sell-off in EU equities might be over as the DAX has managed to defend an important support.</Excerpt>

<Title>AUD/USD surges after RBA decision</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian dollar, also known as the Aussie, rose nearly 1% Tuesday, following a strong Monday as sentiment improved notably in the markets. At the same time, the AUD/USD pair was supported by the latest Reserve Bank of Australia decision.</p>
<h2>RBA moving the Australian dollar</h2>
<p>Earlier today, <strong>the Australian central bank left monetary policy unchanged, with the primary interest rate kept at 0.1%</strong>
, as widely expected. Moreover, the board decided to continue to <strong>Moreover, the board decided to continue to purchase government securities at the rate of 4 billion USD a week until at least mid-February 2022.</strong>
</p>
<p>At its conference following the decision, <strong>the RBA reiterated that it would not increase the cash rate until actual inflation is sustainably within the 2% to 3% target range.</strong>
</p>
<p>Additionally, governors think that the omicron strain is a new source of uncertainty, but it is not expected to derail the recovery. With that in mind, the economy is likely to return to its pre-delta path in the first half of 2022.</p>
<p>Recently, the Australian dollar has benefitted from the fresh policy stimulus in China and the heightened speculation that the RBA could bring an earlier end to their QE program next year.</p>
<span class="quote-author">The tone of the statement does suggest that the RBA is expecting the Australian economy to continue recovering in the year ahead, which will require a further withdrawal of policy stimulus,</span>
<span class="post-quote">economists at MUFG Bank think.</span>
<p>From other news, the Chinese trade balance in USD worsened to 71.72 billion in November, down from 84.54 billion in October. Exports slowed to 22% from 27% previously, while imports to the country rose sharply to 31.4%, up from 20.6% in October.</p>
<p>During the US session, nonfarm productivity and unit labor costs data for the third quarter will be released, but they usually don't move the markets.</p>
<h2>Short-term charts now look bullish</h2>
<p>The Aussie is now testing the significant resistance of previous lows at 0.71, where the short-term downtrend is also located. Should the pair close above this level on a daily chart, we could see another leg higher, targeting 0.7170.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the MACD indicator is close to sending a bullish signal from a profoundly negative zone, reinforcing the bullish narrative. The Aussie is also oversold on the daily chart, setting the stage for a possible reversal.</p>
<p>Sentiment in the markets seems bullish as fears from the Omicron variant dissipated quickly, helping commodity-linked currencies to erase some of the losses suffered in November.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if bears defend the mentioned resistance near 0.71, we might see another decline to the psychological zone at 0.70.</p>

<Title>USD/CAD calm after Bank of Canada decision</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The USD/CAD pair traded in a narrow range Wednesday, failing to move notably following the latest Bank of Canada monetary policy decision.</p>
<h2>Bank of Canada disappoints CAD bulls</h2>
<p>As widely expected, the Canadian central bank left monetary policy unchanged, and the primary was kept at 0.25%.</p>
<p>In the following statement, the central bank forecasts <strong>CPI inflation to remain elevated in the first half of 2022, but it would likely moderate by the second half, toward the 2% level</strong>
.</p>
<p>Regarding the economic outlook, <strong>the Bank of Canada stated that the economy had “considerable momentum” into the Q4, including the improvement in the labor market</strong>
, which brought the employment rate back to its pre-pandemic level.</p>
<p>However, floods in British Columbia and uncertainty from the omicron variant “could weigh on growth by compounding supply chain disruptions, cutting demand for some services.”</p>
<p>The BoC also commented that “given ongoing excess capacity,” the Canadian economy would continue to require monetary policy support and emphasized that they are “committed to holding the rate” until economic slack is absorbed. According to the BoC October projection, that will happen sometime in the middle of 2022.</p>
<p>The USD/CAD pair’s reaction was muted, and it spiked circa 30 pips after the decision, pushing the pair back above 1.2650.</p>
<p>On the US data front, the JOLTS Job Openings indicator was released, rising to 11.03 million in October, up from 10.44 million in September, but causing no volatility in the markets.</p>
<h2>Technically speaking, the pair seems to be topping</h2>
<p>The Canadian dollar strengthened this week, supported by the recovery in “risky” assets following the recent plunge. Additionally, the CAD received some support from the rising oil prices as the WTI benchmark managed to rise back above its 200-day moving average at 70 USD, confirming the medium-term uptrend.</p>
<p>The Loonie could rise further as the MACD indicator sent a bearish signal on the USD/CAD daily chart, implying a possible decline in the pair. The short-term support could be found at 1.26, while the next target below that support should be at 1.25, where the 200-day moving average is.</p>
<p><strong>It also looks like a multiple top pattern above 1.28, with a potential to send the pair notably lower, just like it has done several times already</strong>
.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if bulls reappear, the initial resistance might be in the 1.2720 zone, followed by the current swing highs in the 1.28 area.</p>

<Excerpt>The BoC decision has failed to induce volatility in the pair and it consolidated during the US session.</Excerpt>

<Title>Are the indices done with the correction?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>S&P 500</h2>
<p>Looking at S&P 500, the entire correction seems to be erased. This is exactly the type of movement that S&P 500 tends to do. Once every 30 to 35 days, S&P 500 falls down just to be brought back up and continue to attack the previous ATH. Just a very quick correction. And that is also what happened now.</p>
<p>It might look horribly on the 4h chart, but on the daily chart we have not invalidated any important levels or structures. We did not close below the trendline and we even did not create a new LOW. Thus, there is no reason for any worries when it comes to S&P 500. When it comes to trading, a long position might be more suitable for the current situation, but entries to the position might be a bit more complicated. If we fall down a bit, an interesting entry to the position might be around 4 604 – 4 622.</p>

<span class="img-caption">S&P 500 4h chart</span>
<h2>NASDAQ</h2>
<p>NASDAQ is not as bullish as S&P 500, but we can also see that the support was only touched and then brought back up. Yet, if there is a movement to levels of 189 and 197, it would not be anything surprising. But even this movement shows, how bullish the current situation is for indices. There was no hesitation around the support level and the reaction – the upward movement -  came quickly. NASDAQ is still not as close to reaching its ATH as S&P 500 is, but the same movement is expected there.</p>

<span class="img-caption">NASDAQ 4h chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It looks like the correction is over and we can go higher to maybe even create new ATH. Indices are still only creating a higher lows and higher highs. This is very typical for a bull market. If all these structures and principles are in line, the talks about bear market are unreasonable.</p>

<Excerpt>Today we will briefly look at the two main indices, S&P 500 and NASDAQ. In the past articles we have talked about possible correction, which was quickly brought back up. What are the charts currently showing and is there a reason to be worried?</Excerpt>

<Title>EUR/GBP finally breaks above 200-day moving average</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The euro-sterling cross advanced notably Wednesday as new COVID restrictions were announced in the country, sending the Pound lower.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the cross was seen trading at around 0.8585.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, <strong>the UK PM Boris Johnson said the nation will move to COVID-19 “plan B”, with work from home encouraged and new face mask requirements.</strong>
</p>
<p>“'Plan B' designed to slow down the spread of Omicron variant,” the UK Health Minister Sajid Javid said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
<h2>BoE lagging with rate hikes?</h2>
<p>Following the decision, the investment bank <strong>Goldman Sachs shifted their Bank of England rate expectations in response to the latest surge in Omicron</strong>
, with analysts across many of the top investment banks expecting to see <strong>the MPC delay their December rate hike to February 2022.</strong>
</p>
<p>The GBP/USD pair reacted to the downside, dropping below the 1.32 level, printing fresh one-year lows. That move, combined with some strength in EUR/USD, sent the EUR/GBP cross above its 200-day moving average for the first time since January 2021.</p>
<p>Sterling traders will now focus on tomorrow’s UK manufacturing and industrial production data, which are expected to improve slightly month-on-month but worsen on the yearly basis. Trade balance data will also be released.</p>
<p>There are several ECB speakers scheduled for appearances on Friday, likely influencing the euro.</p>
<h2>Daily chart now looks bullish</h2>
<p><strong>As long as the EUR/GBP cross trades above the 200-day average (0.8550), the short-term outlook seems bullish</strong>
. The cross now needs a daily close above 0.8610 to start another medium-term leg higher toward April highs of 0.8720.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the euro drops below the 200-day average, we might see a decline toward 0.8470.</p>

<Title>S&P 500 statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>0.75%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.82%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.41%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.37%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was <strong>2.07%</strong>
, which is between the first and the second standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>1</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
, which means that we estimate a slightly positive phase of the cycle. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to all MAs, <strong>S&P 500</strong>
 is in bullish sentiment because it is above them. In the event of a decline, monthly MA may be a support to the market price.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, we have witnessed more upward trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>7</strong>
 consecutive days, which is also the maximum increase in the measured period. The downward trend in recent weeks have not exceeded more than <strong>1</strong>
 day. However, the maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>6</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.05%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>1.94%</strong>
, which is almost double the average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-1.80%</strong>
 and <strong>1.80%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>2.40%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis still supports bullish sentiment as the market price creates higher highs and higher lows. The <strong>S&P 500</strong>
 is currently very close to the all-time highs again after this week’s dynamic rebound. The psychological level at <strong>4 500</strong>
 was an important support along with the short-term MA. The divergence between price development and RSI also supported the bullish scenario. In addition, volumes before the rebound were very high. Therefore, the market price could set new highs this month.</p>

<Title>Silver falls to two-month lows amid rising yields, strong USD</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Precious metals have been dropping recently as traders are betting the Fed will be even more hawkish than previously thought, sending short-term yields higher. Both gold and silver usually struggle in such an environment, and this time was no exception.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, silver was down 0.4%, trading below the 22 USD threshold for the first time since late September. Gold was also weaker, falling below 1,770 USD.</p>
<h2>US inflation report under scrutiny</h2>
<p>Later in the day, the critical US CPI report for November is due; <strong>inflation is expected to rise again to 6.8% yearly, up from 6.2% in October. That would be the highest inflation number since 1982</strong>
. Keep in mind that the Fed funds rate was around 15% back in those days. Today, it is at zero.</p>
<p>The core inflation gauge is seen rising to 4.9%, up from 4.6% previously.</p>
<p>The US inflation data is likely to cement the hawkish Fed expectations, <strong>with a 44% probability of a June 2022 rate hike,</strong>
 according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool.</p>
<p>The Fed will decide about monetary policy next Wednesday, possibly announcing a quicker pace of tapering, especially if today’s inflation rises above expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Volatility is expected to be elevated after the CPI release</strong>
. After last month’s report, both gold and silver surged as reported inflation was higher than expected. However, the short-term uptrend died quickly, and traders sold the metals amid more monetary policy tightening and higher yields.</p>
<p>Today’s price action might follow a similar pattern - the initial rally could be sold quickly. However, silver appears very oversold as it has been falling nonstop since the previous CPI report. Therefore, today’s data might actually lead to a more significant bounce from the oversold conditions.</p>
<h2>Is an oversold rally going to happen?</h2>
<p>The daily chart still looks bearish, with the next target at September lows near 21.50 USD. Failure to defend this level would confirm the bearish bias, most likely leading to a decline toward the psychological level of 20 USD.</p>
<p>However, as previously said, silver looks oversold, possibly leading to a short squeeze rally after today’s numbers. The short-term resistance is near this week’s highs at 22.50 USD. A rally above that level could trigger stop-losses of short positions, likely sending the commodity toward the 23 USD threshold.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: One week after the dip</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Key price levels</h2>
<p>The dip that we saw last week not only changed the chart of Bitcoin, but also of some major altcoins. This crucial move, which had huge volumes and saw significant price drops also changed the way we should be looking at things. Thus, if there is something that we can rely on, it would be the key levels.</p>
<p>For Bitcoin, the current most crucial resistance is above 52 000 – 55 000 dollars. Before Bitcoin dropped down below 50 000 dollars, this price range was the most important support we had, which means that now it represents really strong resistance. Once we get over it, the bull market can continue. On the other hand, falling below 40 000 dollars can really harm Bitcoin. Going below this level can significantly increase the probability of the bear market.</p>
<p><strong>Key price levels are as follows</strong>
</p>
<p>Above 55 000 dollars – bull market can continue
Below 40 000 dollars – huge chance of bear market
Between 40 000 – 55 000 dollars – neutral zone</p>
<p>As you can imagine, right now we are in the neutral zone. To be more exact, as of now we are right in the middle of the zone. But there is no difference between the price at 41 000 dollars and 52 000 dollars, since this does not change anything from the point of the key levels.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin 1D chart</span>
<h2>What can we see in the upcoming days?</h2>
<p>The last few days have been relatively similar, with a slight tendency to move downwards. The indicator that you can see in my chart shows the volume at specific price levels. From that indicator you can see the price of Bitcoin is slowly rotating downwards as well. We see no specific impulse to move up. I would be very careful in assessing any buying or trading opportunities.
As we mentioned yesterday, indices look bullish, but Bitcoin does not. Personally, I am waiting for some impulse and I will not be entering any trades until I see one. Relying solely on this chart now is a huge risk.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin 1h chart with volume indicator</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As one could expect, this week did literally nothing important from the long term perspective of Bitcoin. It was only recovering from the Saturdays´ dip. However, next week will be very important mostly because of the FED meeting and tapering, which can have a huge influence on crypto.</p>

<Excerpt>In today's analysis, we will primarily look at the crucial levels that might decide the future of Bitcoin. We will also look at a shorter time frame and see what can happen over the weekend.</Excerpt>

<Title>USD/JPY advances as USD strengthens broadly</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The USD/JPY pair rose 0.35% on Monday and traded at around 113.70 ahead of the US session, quickly erasing Friday’s post CPI losses.</p>
<h2>US inflation & Fed in focus</h2>
<p>Friday's data showed that <strong>the US inflation, measured by the CPI index, rose +6.8% YoY, meeting forecasts. It was the fastest rate of increase since 1982</strong>
. In addition, the core CPI jumped 4.9 YoY, as expected, its highest since 1991.</p>
<p>The greenback fell in the initial reaction, but the dip was bought as <strong>the Fed is expected to raise rates three times in 2022</strong>
. This week’s Federal meeting will be under scrutiny as the central bank will likely fasten the pace of tapering amid soaring inflation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>US yields declined on Friday</strong>
, and it looks like the 10-year yield has given up any bullish attempts, falling below the 1.5% threshold again, possibly undermining the USD/JPY pair.</p>
<h2>Japanese macro data moving the JPY</h2>
<p>From other news, the Japanese Tankan large manufacturing outlook slowed to 13 in Q4, down from 14 in the third quarter. On the other hand, the non-manufacturing outlook improved to 8 from 3 previously. Furthermore, the <strong>the all-industry Capex indicator declined to 9.3% from 10.1%, well below analysts’ expectations of 9.8%</strong>
</p>
<p>Additionally, Japan’s machinery orders fell dramatically year-on-year in October, printing 2.9% from 12.5% in September. However, the monthly change improved sharply to 3.8%.</p>
<p>Commenting on the outcome of the central bank’s Tankan Survey, a Bank of Japan (BoJ) official said, “most firms that replied in December Bank of Japan Tankan likely did not take into account impact of Omicron.”</p>
<p>On inflation, the official noted that Japanese firms' inflation expectations for one year ahead stand at +1.1%, the highest level since September 2015.</p>
<p>Additionally, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he would secure a budget to help the economy recover during an emergency (should the Omicron variant cause further damage to the economy).</p>
<p>The short-term chart is rather neutral as the pair has been moving sideways since November. However, the initial resistance is expected in the 113.85 area, and if bulls push the pair above it, we could see a rally toward 114.50. Two critical resistances are above that: at 115 and 115.50. The greenback must climb above them to confirm the long-term uptrend.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the support is seen in the 113.30 zone before the key medium-term demand zone near 112.60.</p>

<Title>Video: FED scandal explained – possible insider trading?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Possible insider trading?</h2>
<p>Only few weeks ago have we encountered a possible insider trading information right from the highest institutions of all. According to several reports and research, Robert Kaplan and Eric Rosengren, chiefs of Fed in Dallas and Boston respectively, were trading suspicious amount of single stocks in the year 2020. Moreover, doubtful activity was also connected to vice chair Richard Clarida as well as the chairman of the Fed himself, Jerome Powell.</p>
<p>What struck out the most was the fact that while the markets have saw one of the most unpredictable times in recent decades, these officials have been actively trading and their accounts have been doing extremely good. Considering the fact that these officials are of the highest rank in the Fed and they are dealing with very sensitive and confidential information about what might the next steps of this institution be, their overtrading gained more attention they might have hoped for.</p>
<h2>Great explanation and information</h2>
<p>However, this topic is much more problematic than it might look. Therefore, we have decided to include a video which explains it in much more depth. Moreover, it also talks about recent problems with inflation or CBDCs. We highly recommend this short <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3NlyGa_uRQ">video </a>
 to anyone, who wants to know more about few of the most pressing problems in the financial markets of the past few weeks.</p>

<Title>GBP/JPY ticks higher after UK labor market data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The Pound advanced slightly on Tuesday, supported by the latest data from the country. At the time of writing, the GBP/JPY cross was up 0.30%, trading near 150.40.</p>
<h2>UK labor market stays strong</h2>
<p>Earlier today, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) informed that the 3Mo unemployment rate improved a notch to 4.2% in October, down from 4.3% previously. In November, the claimant count change dropped to -49,800 from -14,900 in October. The number of people jobless and seeking work dropped by 127,000 to 1.423 million in the three months to the end of October.</p>
<p>The UK’s average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, arrived at 4.3% 3Mo/YoY in October versus +5.0% last and +4.0% expected. The gauge, including bonuses, came in at 4.9% 3Mo/YoY in October versus +5.9% previous and +4.5% expected.</p>
<span class="quote-author">With no sign of the end of the furlough scheme hitting the number of jobs, the total of employees on payroll continued to grow strongly in November,</span>
<span class="post-quote">Darren Morgan, the ONS's economic statistics director, said. </span>
<p>The numbers suggest the labor market remained strong despite the withdrawal of government support to cover the wages of workers temporarily told not to report for work. Some economists had feared a surge in unemployment as government support measures ended.</p>
<p>The Pound ticked higher after the data. However, buying seems limited heading into this week’s Bank of England policy meeting. Despite soaring inflation, the Bank of England is now expected to stay pat and not raise rates. A couple of weeks ago, the broad consensus was for the BoE to raise interest rates. However, that changed quickly as the Omicron variant spread in the UK, prompting the government to re-start tightening measures. Only two of nine MPC members are currently seen voting for a rate hike.</p>
<p>Later today, the US PPI indices are due, expected to continue rising. The yearly change will likely soar to 9.2%, up from 8.6% previously, while the monthly change is expected to stay unchanged at 0.6%. The core PPI index is seen rising to 7.2% year-on-year, up from 6.8% in October.</p>
<h2>Sterling defends significant support</h2>
<p>It looks like the bulls have managed to defend the crucial horizontal support at around 149.20. As long as the Pound trades above it, the medium-term trend still appears bullish. The next target in the bullish wave will be at the 200-day moving average near 152.50. The MACD indicator is about to send a bullish signal on the daily chart, reinforcing the bullish narrative.</p>
<p>However, if the support is broken to the downside, significant stop losses could be hit, likely dragging the Pound further lower to 147, representing fresh ten-month lows for the Pound.</p>

<Title>XCU/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.27%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.22%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.64%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.59%</strong>
. Today´s return is <strong>-0.40%</strong>
, which is well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently negative (<strong>-1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-1</strong>
 for price indexation. This means that we are in the middle of the negative phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical systems is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. <strong>XCU/USD</strong>
 fell below short-term and medium-term MAs last week. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, the monthly MA can only be a support for the price.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our last analysis, we have witnessed more downward trends that did not exceed <strong>3</strong>
 consecutive days. The total maximum in the measured period (last 3 years) is <strong>12</strong>
 days. The upward trends in recent months have not exceeded more than <strong>2</strong>
 days. The total maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>14</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.88%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>1.21%</strong>
, which is below average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-2.5%</strong>
 and <strong>2.5%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>3.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<p>The basic technical analysis points to a sideways trending since March this year. The channel ranges from approximately <strong>4.000 USD</strong>
 up to <strong>4.800 USD</strong>
. The lower boundary of channel is formed by the psychological level and the demand zone (green rectangle). The upper limit of channel is also formed by the psychological level and the supply zone (red rectangle). The <strong>XCU/USD</strong>
 is currently below the short-term and long-term moving averages, which could act as resistances. However, divergence between price development and the RSI could support the bulls. In addition, volumes have slowed in recent days.</p>

<Excerpt>The change in inventory by London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses is positive for 5 consecutive days. The negative correlation of this indicator thus confirms the negative development in recent days. The current price of XCU/USD - Copper Spot US Dollar is 4.263 (December 14, 2021). Therefore, we will now look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>AUD/USD surges after Chinese data; awaits FOMC verdict</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian dollar was bid on Wednesday, helped by the recent batch of Chinese data. At the time of writing, the AUD/USD pair traded half a percent higher on the day, moving above 0.7130.</p>
<h2>Chinese data boost the Aussie today</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, <strong>Chinese industrial production rose 3.8% year-on-year for November, up from 3.5% scored previously</strong>
. On the other hand, <strong>retail sales in the country slid to 3.9% from 4.9% in October</strong>
, while <strong>fixed-asset investment declined notably to 5.2%, down from 6.1% in the previous reading</strong>
. It looks like investors had been expecting worse numbers as the Australian dollar was bought afterward.</p>
<p>Following the release of the November activity numbers, China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released a statement, expressing their take on the economy:</p>
<li>Economic recovery is facing many constraints.</li>
<li>November indicators are in a reasonable range.</li>
<li>China's economy continued to improve.</li>
<li>Semiconductor shortage for the auto sector has eased a little.</li>
<li>Overall real estate market is stable.</li>
<li>Some cities face more pressure due to people outflows, economic difficulties.</li>
<h2>US data & Fed under scrutiny</h2>
<p>Later in the session, <strong>the US retail sales for November are due, expected to decline notably from October's levels</strong>
. Additionally, December's New York Empire State Manufacturing Index is anticipated to decrease to 25 from 30.9 in November.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>the Fed’s monetary policy meeting outcome is due and the central bank is widely expected to double the tapering pace</strong>
, amid the ongoing surge in inflation. Furthermore, the Fed will likely telegraph the need for tighter monetary policy, leading to two or three rate hikes in the following year.</p>
<p>Volatility will likely be elevated after the decision, so careful trading is advised.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the Australian dollar has managed to bounce off August lows near 0.71. As long as it trades above that level, the short-term trend seems bullish.</p>
<p>The MACD indicator sent a bullish signal on the daily chart, reinforcing the bullish narrative.</p>
<p>The next target for bulls will be at 0.7170, where October lows are converged with December highs. If the Aussie rises above that level, the medium-term trend could change to bullish, targeting 0.7320.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a failure to stay above 0.710 could lead to a retest of the current cycle lows near the psychological level of 0.70. Everything could be decided after tonight’s FOMC decision.</p>

<Title>S&P 500 and the meeting of the FED</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Key points</h2>
<p>1.The interest rates remain unchanged.</p>
<p>2.Tapering has increased in December from 15 billion dollars to 30 billion dollars.</p>
<p>3.The year 2022 should see interest rate hikes on three occasions.</p>
<h3>What was the immediate reaction in the charts?</h3>
<p>If we look at the chart closely, we can see that during the meeting the chart was slowly going upwards. The market appears to be liking these decisions and it is possible that we might see new maximums in coming days. Its more than obvious that markets interpreted this news as positive.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/20_S_and_P_500_a_FED_meeting_34b0ff1d5d.png" alt="S&P 500 1h chart">
<span class="img-caption">S&P 500 1h chart</span>
<h3>What does this mean for the future?</h3>
<p>I believe that markets reacted this way mainly because the decision from FED was expected. Tapering was talked about on several occasions before. It was also expected that as of now, the interest rates will not change. Due to the new policies in place, tapering should be over by March 2022. Moreover, Jerome Powell has specified that the interest rates hike will only began once the tapering is over.</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why they mentioned that it is possible that in the coming year, we can see the interest rates rise three times. Good news is that Powell is signalling this well ahead, which means that the markets can already start pricing this information in. This means that even the increase in interest rates itself does not need to be met with negative reaction. The decision to announce this is definitely good for the overall health of the markets, since the reaction to unexpected rate hikes would probably be more severe.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>S&P 500 reacted positively to the news which came about from the FOMC meeting. FED played it really well and has solid options for the future policies. The unprecedented stimulus will need to stop soon, since inflation is increasing all around the world. Central banks have to start solving this problem as soon as possible, which is one of the reasons why we can really expect rate hikes in 2022. The only question now is whether FED can keep this speed of tapering and what would be the reaction of the market. If the reaction will be negative, it is possible that FED will have to ease the monetary policy again.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Yesterday, 15th of December 2021, was one of the most important FED meetings we have seen in recent years. Thus we will shortly discuss what decisions were made and what impact can they have on the market with the example of S&P 500 index.</Excerpt>

<Title>GBP/USD spikes after BoE surprises with a rate hike</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The Pound was strongly bid on Thursday, following the latest Bank of England decision. As a result, the GBP/USD pair rose circa 100 pips to 1.33550 during the London session, trading at the highest level in three weeks.</p>
<h2>BoE hikes rates</h2>
<p>Earlier today, <strong>the Bank of England hiked rates, defying expectations, and brought the primary rate to 0.25%</strong>
. Eight MPC members voted for a rate hike (versus two expected), nearly a unanimous decision.</p>
<p>Investors anticipate the central bank to continue hiking in 2022, with three more rate hikes currently priced in by the markets.</p>
<p>Inflation in the UK continues to rise (as everywhere else in the world). <strong>This week’s data showed annual inflation surged to 5.1% in November from 4.2% the month before</strong>
, coming in above consensus expectations of 4.8% and the Bank of England’s forecast for 4.5%. It was the highest annual rate since September 2011.</p>
<p>That might have been the reason why the BoE decided to start the lift-off. Still, COVID cases are rising again, prompting the government to tighten measures.</p>
<p>Policymakers said more "modest" tightening is likely needed as inflation heads toward a peak likely to be around 6% in April. Meanwhile, <strong>the bank revised down their GDP forecasts for 2021 4Q by about 0.5% since the November Report</strong>
 (likely due to Omicron concerns).</p>
<p>From other news, France announced that it will close borders for UK tourists from Saturday morning, even though many scientists are now claiming the Omicron variant to be much weaker than previous variants.</p>
<h2>Fed also hawkish, but USD dives</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, <strong>The Fed sounded hawkish, and Jerome Powell announced that the central bank would double the rate of its tapering of bond purchases amid continued rising inflation. He further outlined that the Fed will likely hike rates three times in 2022.</strong>
 Nevertheless, the USD dropped notably after the decision, ending its short-term uptrend in many pairs.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the GBP/USD pair has broken above the short-term bearish trend line from November highs, confirming the short-term reversal. The next target in this relief rally is expected at 1.3415, where September lows are. Other significant selling levels are at 1.35 and 1.36.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the price returns below 1.33 again, we could see a quick decline toward the 1.32 threshold.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>It looks the Pound could rally further, supported by the BoE decision and weaker USD.</Excerpt>

<Title>Bitcoin Friday: BTC still has not done the crucial move</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Never changing situation of Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>Since the last time Bitcoin has severely broken down, not much has happened. We have been mostly consolidating for the past two weeks. Looking at the 4-hour chart, the situation does not look great. We have not broken down yet, but we are creating lower Highs and we have not broken any significant trendline upwards. This means that it is really hard to try to find any signs of bullishness, since there are almost no confirmations of bulls being in charge. No upward trendline was broken, nor higher High was created and BTC is still simply testing the same support. When it comes to TA rules, the longer chart keeps testing the same level, the greater the chance that it will not last.</p>
<p>However, I do like the overall look of both, Bitcoin as well as altcoins. Both of them have nice structures that are ready to explode once we get the first big impulse. Yet, it does not matter if the  impulse does not come. Most of the coins are at very solid support levels and it is even possible that we are creating local bottom, but we see no crucial upward movement. The fact that we are simply at a support level, does not necessarily mean that we are going to be pushed back up. It is only a higher chance of getting the needed push, but it has not come yet.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/21_Bitcoin_Friday_BTC_c433cda327.png" alt="Bitcoin creating lower lows - 4h chart">
<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin creating lower highs - 4h chart</span>
<h2>BTC is rising only if S&P 500 is rising</h2>
<p>This is something that I have been looking at since the downward break. There are two important moments that we need to mention. First one is the fact that during the weekend, the equities are not being traded. That is one of the good times for Bitcoin to make the decisive move by itself and does not need to be bothered by indices. However, what happened last week? Absolutely nothing. Bitcoin barely moved. This week we saw only one noticeable upward movement and that was on Wednesday during the FED meeting, during which both the S&P 500 and BTC were both rising, which was the second important moment. However, if the S&P 500 is not rising, Bitcoin seems to be having a tougher time.</p>
<p>That means that as of now Bitcoin looks like if it was not able to move by itself. While we saw a new ATH at S&P 500 yesterday, after which a dip occurred, Bitcoin is far from reaching its previous ATH levels (69 000 dollars).</p>

<span class="img-caption">S&P 500  - 4h chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I will be waiting for some kind of impulse with Bitcoin. Unless Bitcoin does something significant, I will try to not enter into many positions. We are at the support levels which might look promising to enter, however, the market has not shown any will or power to move up.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>Today we will look once more at the connection between Bitcoin and S&P 500, since in the last few days it seems to be getting stronger.</Excerpt>

<Title>XAG/USD statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.30%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.36%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.67%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.62%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>-0.50%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently very positive (<strong>3</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>3</strong>
 for price indexation. It means that we are in the early positive phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to all MAs, <strong>XAG/USD</strong>
 is in bearish sentiment because it is below them. In the event of a rebound, the monthly MA may be a resistance to the market price.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our <a href="https://investro.com/commodities/xag-usd-statistical-and-technical-analysis-5">last analysis</a>
, there have been more declining trends, with a maximum of <strong>4</strong>
 consecutive days. The total maximum for the downtrend for the last 3 years is <strong>8</strong>
 days. Upward trends have not exceeded more than <strong>2</strong>
 consecutive days in recent months. The total maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>5</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>2.71%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.18%</strong>
, which is below average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.00%</strong>
 and <strong>3.00%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>4.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to the short-term bearish development in recent weeks. Recently, however, there has been a rebound in the lower part of the demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>38.20%</strong>
 and the short-term moving average. In addition, the divergence between price development and the RSI could motivate bulls to take power. In the case of a further decline, additional support for the bulls could be the psychological level of <strong>21.00</strong>
 or the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50.00%</strong>
.</p>

<Excerpt>A more hawkish tone in the FOMC press conference motivated short-term bulls in precious metals, mainly due to rising inflation. The current price of XAG/USD - Silver Spot US Dollar is 22.35 (December 19, 2021). So, let’s move on to statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>SP500 down sharply as Omicron fears reappear</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The SP500 index crashed nearly 2% on Monday, drooping to two-week lows as Fed’s tightening and fresh Omicron scare led to a sharp decline in risk assets.</p>
<p><strong>In the Netherlands, the government has announced a fresh lockdown, lasting for at least till the middle of January</strong>
. In the rest of Europe, governments are holding emergency meetings on new restrictions.</p>
<p>France and Germany imposed bans on arrivals from UK nationals. In addition, the government has said that all bars, restaurants, and cinemas must close by 8 pm in Ireland.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, warned on Sunday that the extraordinarily contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus was raging worldwide and that it was likely to cause another significant surge in the United States, especially among the unvaccinated.</p>
<p>During its last week’s decision, <strong>the Fed doubled the tapering amount, ending the QE much sooner, while the central bank now sees three rate hikes in 2022</strong>
. On Wednesday, the hawkish statement was ignored, but traders woke up on Thursday and sold stocks quickly.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Fed speakers reiterated their hawkish stance recently, mainly due to the soaring inflation. <strong>The Fed Governor Chris Waller stated that a rate increase in March would be "very likely,</strong>
" while Mary Daly, president of the San Francisco Fed, said she would support two or three rate hikes next year.</p>
<p>There are no significant macroeconomic data on schedule this week, apart from the revision of the third-quarter GDP on Wednesday and durable goods orders on Thursday. Therefore, volatility could gradually decline heading into the Christmas holiday.</p>
<h2>Daily chart is not looking positive right now</h2>
<p>The following support will likely be at the 4,500 USD level, where November lows are. If the price drops below it, the medium-term uptrend could be over, possibly leading to the test of the 200-day moving average at 4,370 USD for the first time since June 2020.</p>
<p>Corrections to the 200-day average are welcome in a long-term uptrend, but it will be crucial to defending that level. If not, we could see a decline toward 4,300 USD pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if sentiment improves, the short-term resistance is near 4,600 USD, and if broken to the upside, the index will likely jump to the all-time highs in the 4,700 USD region.</p>

<Title>GBP/CAD attacks 200-day moving average</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The GBP/CAD cross has surged recently and is up for nine consecutive days, trading at the highest level in two months as the Canadian dollar weakened amid falling oil prices.</p>
<p>The macro calendar is rather empty today, but data released earlier by the Office for National Statistics showed public borrowing fell in November as spending on the pandemic eased and the furlough scheme came to an end but was still the second-highest figure for the month since records began in 1993.</p>
<p>Public sector net borrowing fell by 4.9 billion GBP from November last year to 17.4 billion GBP. However, this was higher than the 16 billion GBP expected by analysts and above the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecast of 14.2 billion GBP.</p>
<p><strong>The year-on-year decline was largely due to the fact that most of the country was in lockdown last year.</strong>
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the total debt reached 2.32 trillion GBP, equivalent to 96.1% of GDP and the worst ratio since March 1963. Considering the next round of lockdowns in the UK over the winter period, debt will continue to rise notably.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Politico tweeted earlier that Boris Johnson is stuck between his scientific advisers and an increasingly disaffected Conservative Party over the seismic decision of whether to bring in new COVID measures over the Christmas Period.</p>
<h2>CAD suffers amid weak oil</h2>
<p>From other news, the Canadian dollar could be volatile after Canadian retail sales for October, due later in the day, and expected to improve notably month-on-month.</p>
<p>As previously said, the Loonie has been undermined by the falling oil prices. The WTI benchmark declined below 70 USD and the commodity is down 20% from this year’s highs at 85 USD. Therefore, some selling pressure appeared in the CAD, pushing the USD/CAD pair to the highest level in more than a year (the weakest level for the Canadian dollar in more than a year).</p>
<h2>Short-term overbought</h2>
<p>The GBP/CAD cross is now advancing toward the 200-day moving average, located near 1.7170. As the Pound seems overbought, considering the sharp two-week rally, we might see some profit-taking at the 200-day average, possibly ending the short-term uptrend for a while.</p>
<p>The support remains at the psychological level of 1.70 and as long as the price trades above it, the immediate trend seems bullish.</p>
<p>A bullish breakout above the 200DMA could push the price further higher, targeting the lows of the summer consolidation near 1.7270.</p>
]]></Content>
<Excerpt>It looks like the recent spike in GBP/CAD could be over soon as the price is about to test a strong resistance.</Excerpt>

<Title>Nikkei 225 statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.01%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.04%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.53%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.50%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was <strong>2.08%</strong>
, which is between the first and the second standard deviation. Our scoring is currently negative (<strong>-2</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-2</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
, which means that we are still estimating the negative phase of the cycle. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>In the second half of this year, we have witnessed more downward trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>7</strong>
 consecutive days, which is also the maximum increase in the measured period. The upward trend in recent weeks have not exceeded more than <strong>3</strong>
 days. However, the maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>9</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>1.41%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.20%</strong>
, which is more than average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-2.40%</strong>
 and <strong>2.40%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>The basic technical analysis points to a sideways trading since the beginning of this year. The <strong>Nikkei 225</strong>
 is currently close to the demand zone (green rectangle), where is also Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
 along with the psychological level at <strong>27 000</strong>
. If the price falls below the zone, it can easily fall by more than <strong>10%</strong>
 in the current market environment. However, if it rises above the MAs that are close to each other, we could see a test of this year’s highs.</p>

<Excerpt>Fundamental valuation of the Japanese stock market looks much better compared to other developed markets. In addition, it has still room to test the all-time highs in 1989/1990. The current price of Nikkei 225 is 28 518 (December 21, 2021). Let’s now look at statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>FTSE rests after this week’s rally</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The British FTSE 100 index was seen somewhat lower during the London session on Wednesday, trading near 7,320 GBP.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, data released today showed that the UK economy expanded 1.1% during the third quarter of 2021, lower than the 1.3% estimated in the preliminary report.
On the other hand, the yearly gauge was upwardly revised to 6.8% from 6.6% reported previously.</p>
<p>Additionally, the current account deficit nearly doubled in Q3, rising to 24.44 billion GDP, from the deficit of 13.46 billion GDP in the second quarter. Lastly, the quarterly change in total investment fell to -2.5% (from 0.4 previously), but the yearly gauge advanced notably, from 0.8% to 2.6%.</p>
<p>The FTSE index failed to react to these data and remained slightly lower on the day, consolidating after this week’s huger rally.</p>
<p>From other news, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would not introduce new curbs in England before Christmas, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced 1 billion GBP of extra support for businesses hit hardest by the recent surge.</p>
<p>Later today, the US third-quarter GDP revision is due along with PCE indices. However, these data are not expected to cause any volatility as most market participants are already off for the Christmas holiday.</p>
<p>Additionally, existing home sales will be published, and the consumer confidence index for December is due as well. Lastly, the EIA crude oil stocks are on the schedule today.</p>
<p>Monday’s candle looks like a perfect bullish pin bar, sending the price sharply higher yesterday. The short-term trend still seems bullish as the index is again attacking this year’s highs.</p>
<p>The key resistance is in the 7,350 - 7,400 GBP area. Once that is broken to the upside, we might see another leg higher toward the 8,000 GBP level (from the medium-term perspective).</p>
<p>It looks like traders are ignoring rate hikes in the BoE (and monetary policy tightening in the US), possibly supporting the indices in 2022.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the support is now seen at 7,250 GBP, followed by the strong buying zone near 7,100 GBP, where this week’s lows are converged with the 200-day moving average.</p>

<Title>Can S&P 500 create a new ATH before the year ends?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>The overall trend</h2>
<p>If we look at the overall price action of the whole year for this index, we can see a clear bull market. S&P 500 has corrections or price dips that are normal for this index and which are usually fairly sharp. However, all these corrections have had a quick rebounce and they never fell below previous LOW. Even if we do not have a clear trendline for the overall structure, S&P 500 respects the previous lows and never falls below. This is still a rather strong bullmarket.</p>

<span class="img-caption">S&P 500 long term outlook</span>
<h2>What about the current range?</h2>
<p>As of now, index is moving in a range. Usually, if we see a movement in the range, the longer the asset moves in it, the bigger the break out of it can be seen. Thus, it is important that S&P 500 moves mostly in the upper part of the range, since there would be a bigger chance of upside movement. Luckily, that is currently happening. We have tested the ATH on two occasions, but it always retracted back down. The longer the price keeps testing this level, the higher the chance it breaks it.</p>
<p>It is also positive to see that in the last dip that we saw, S&P 500 did not create a double bottom, but only created a higher low. This also means that in my eyes, S&P 500 is still really bullish. Yet, I think the chances for the break of ATH in 2021 are 50/50. We can be sure that ATH will be broken soon, but whether that happens this year remains to be seen.</p>

<Title>USD/JPY spikes to one month-highs after barrage of US data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The USD/JPY pair was bid Thursday, as sentiment improved notably and traders bought stocks and carry-trades. At the time of writing, the greenback jumped to 114.50, its highest level since late November.</p>
<h2>Full US calendar</h2>
<p>Traders paid attention to today's US durable goods orders data, which surprised to the upside and printed 2.5% in November, up from 0.1% in October. Additionally, the ex transportation gauge rose to 0.8% from 0.3% previously.</p>
<p>However, the value of core capital goods orders, a proxy for business investment in equipment that excludes aircraft and military hardware, dropped 0.1% in November (following an upwardly revised 0.9% increase in October).</p>
<p>Additionally, the US initial jobless claims stayed at 205,000, exactly as expected, while continuing jobless claims fell slightly to 1.859 million from 1.867 million in the previous week.</p>
<p>Furthermore, US personal income ticked lower in November to 0.4% from 0.5%, while personal spending more than halved from 1.4% to 0.8%, leading to a decline in the savings rate to its lowest since December 2017.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the Michigan consumer sentiment index ticked higher to 70.6 in December, pointing to a very modest rebound from post-COVID (and ten-year) lows.</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, The Fed's favorite inflation indicator - the core PCE deflator - soared in the last month. The headline PCE deflator hit 5.7% YoY, the highest since June 1982.</p>
<h2>Dovish Japanese officials</h2>
<p>From other news, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said that Monetary easing played a crucial role in achieving fairly early economic recovery from the pandemic.</p>
<p>Additionally, he noted that weak yen helps increase export volume, profits Japan firms earn overseas but pressures household income and domestic-oriented firms' profits.</p>
<p>At the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said he hopes the Bank of Japan  continues to make efforts to achieve the 2% price goal. While inflation rages elsewhere and the CPI is on its way to double digits in most G7 countries, Japan seems to be the only exception where inflation remained muted.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the next key resistance is in the 115.20 area, where the current cycle highs are. If the pair jumps above it, we might see a rally toward 120 in the following year. That level has been unseen since early 2016.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the short-term support is seen near 113.85 and if not held, further demand should be expected at November/December lows in the 112.75 area.</p>

<Title>EUR/JPY jumps to five-month highs amid optimistic sentiment</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The EUR/JPY cross continued to enjoy the benefits of the positive sentiment in the markets and traded 0.35% higher during the London session, rising toward the important 130 level.</p>
<h2>Japanese macroeconomic news undermines the JPY</h2>
<p>Earlier today, Japanese large retail sales improved slightly to 1.4% for October, up from 0.9% previously. At the same time, retail trade rose to 1.9% year-on-year, more than double the 0.9% scored in September. As a result, the monthly change also ticked higher.</p>
<p>In addition to the Japanese data, the Bank of Japan’s latest Summary of Opinions was also released but failed to cause any significant movements in the JPY pairs.</p>
<p>Bank of Japan policymakers discussed recent rising inflationary pressures that could force them to alter their view the country remained vulnerable to the risk of deflation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, In the following quarterly report due in January, it's necessary to examine whether the current assessment - that risks to prices are skewed to the downside - remains appropriate. The JPY slid lower after the report.</p>
<p>Later today, the US Dallas Fed Manufacturing Business Index for December is due and is expected to improve slightly to 13.2 from 11.8 previously. However, since liquidity is thin in the markets, volatility will likely be minimal throughout the day.</p>
<p>It looks like sentiment remains bullish in the markets, judging from the US equities, which continue to advance today.</p>
<h2>The short-term chart seems bullish</h2>
<p>If the EUR/JPY cross jumps above 130, there is a critical resistance zone between 130.40 - 130.70, where previous lows, highs, and the 200-day moving average are all converged. Rising beyond that level would likely change the medium-term trend to bullish, targeting 132.00.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the short-term support could be located at 129.50, and if not held, the euro could decline below 129.00. The long-term major demand zone remains in the vicinity of 127.50.</p>

<Title>SP500 posts new record highs as Santa Claus rally holds strong</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The SP500 index continued to climb higher, posting fresh all-time highs this week and trading above 4,800 USD today.</p>
<p>Many analysts and investments bank remain bullish on equities, despite rising US yields and monetary policy tightening in the US.</p>
<p>Strategists at UBS continue to see upside for equities. Energy and financials are set to outperform. While volatility is expected, they believe a still-accommodative policy backdrop, along with solid economic and corporate fundamentals, should support further upside for equities. Still, they favor the likely winners from global growth, including energy and financials, balanced with exposure to more defensive sectors like healthcare.</p>
<p>At the same time, economists at Credit Suisse look for the S&P 500 Index to move to 4970/5000, potentially as far as 5200. They would not rule an overshoot towards 5200 (10% higher), but our bias at present is similarly not for a move beyond here.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, the SP500 index hasn’t touched its 200-day moving average since July 2022. That is one and a half years above the 200-day average, an unusual statistical anomaly.</p>
<h2>US data failed to move the markets</h2>
<p>From other news, the Richmond Fed Manufacturing index improved slightly in December, printing 16, up from 12 in November. Additionally, the housing price index for October rose to 1.1% monthly, up from 0.9% previously. Finally, the SP/Case Shiller home price indices eased slightly to 18.4% year-on-year, down from 19.1% in September.</p>
<p>Liquidity will likely stay low throughout the rest of the week as most market participants are usually out of offices during this period.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Goldman Sachs expects the Fed to start the lift-off in March. The Fed will likely deliver two more rate hikes after that in 2022. Nevertheless, US indices remain strong.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the trend still seems bullish. The short-term support is in the 4,740 - 4,700 USD zone, while the medium-term demand zone is near December lows of 4,500 USD. The 200-day average is currently below 4,400 USD (9% below the actual price).</p>
<p>It looks like the index will indeed reach the magical level of 5,000 USD pretty soon.</p>

<Title>Crude Oil (WTI) statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.76%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.96%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.91%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.93%</strong>
. Yesterday’s return was <strong>2.41%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently positive (<strong>1</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>1</strong>
 for price indexation. Therefore, it is currently in a slightly positive phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The estimated development of cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. As we can see in the chart below, all <strong>WTI</strong>
 MAs currently support bullish sentiment. In the event of a decline, the 6 months MA may be the price support.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/211227_Mo_M_8965230cc6.jpg" alt="WTI daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our <a href="https://investro.com/commodities/crude-oil-wti-statistical-and-technical-analysis-5">last analysis</a>
, there have been stronger upward trends with a maximum level of <strong>4</strong>
 consecutive days, even the price is much lower. The maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>8</strong>
 days. Downward trends did not exceed more than one day in the same period. However, the maximum decrease was <strong>11</strong>
 days in the measured period. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.30%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>3.35%</strong>
, which is almost average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.60%</strong>
 and <strong>3.60%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>6.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Basic technical analysis points to positive sentiment this month, as the market price creates higher highs and higher lows. The last uptrend leg rose by more than <strong>10 USD</strong>
 after a rebound from the psychological level of <strong>68.00</strong>
, supported by long-term MA. However, there is a bearish divergence between price development and the RSI that has developed in recent weeks. The psychological level of <strong>77.00</strong>
 along with the short-term MA could be an important resistance to the market price.</p>

<Title>Silver declines after Tuesday’s bearish pin bar</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Precious metals weakened on Wednesday, with silver losing 1.3% and dropping below 23 USD, while gold fell below 1,800 USD ahead of the US session.</p>
<h2>Several bearish factors for silver</h2>
<p>Yesterday’s daily candle on silver looks like a bearish pin bar - a bearish reversal pattern, implying the short-term uptrend might be over for now.</p>
<p>Additionally, the EURUSD pair lacks any bullish momentum, and the euro declined back below 1.13 today, strengthening the US dollar. The dollar index still trades above the strong support of 95.50-96.00, potentially limiting the upside in metals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the two-year US yield rose to new cycle highs and traded above 0.75% for the first time since March 2020 as the Fed is getting ready to hike short-term interest rates.</p>
<p>As of right now, the market believes the US central bank will deliver the first rate hike in March, while two more rate increases are expected throughout the rest of the year.</p>
<p>The UBS bank is bullish on the USD and bearish on gold (silver) heading into 2022. They expect the US dollar to strengthen further in the year ahead as the Fed withdraws monetary accommodation faster than some other major central banks. They hold a positive view on oil as demand hits new highs and a negative outlook on gold against a backdrop of rising rates and a belief that inflation will fall.</p>
<h2>Short-term outlook looks negative</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, the next support is expected in the 22.50 USD area. If bulls fail to defend it, silver could very well crash toward the most significant buying zone at this year’s lows at 21.50 USD. The short-term negative momentum remains reinforced by the mentioned bearish pin bar.</p>
<p>A decline below 21.50 USD would confirm the long-term bearish trend, likely sending the commodity toward the psychological level of 20.00 USD.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if buyers reemerge, the resistance is at this week’s highs below 23.50 USD. Therefore, silver must jump above to cancel the immediate bearish threat.</p>

<Title>GBP/USD jumps to one-month highs</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Sterling capitalized on the USD weakness and pushed above the 1.35 threshold for the first time since late November.</p>
<h2>Omicron rages</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the UK recorded a fresh all-time high in daily covid cases to the tune of above 122,000. Britain’s NHS "is now on a war footing," one of its top medical officials warned on Thursday. He said they would start erecting field hospitals to absorb a feared surge in hospitalizations as cases continue to climb. In a statement, the service outlined plans for temporary wards in England, called "Nightingale hubs," in response to the surge in Omicron cases.</p>
<p>However, despite the massive surge in cases, deaths remain low. Furthermore, they show no signs of spiking with the cases, likely confirming that the Omicron variant is less severe than the previous variants of the virus. Additionally, it looks like the Omicron wave in South Africa is already over as cases there have dropped significantly. Therefore, the panic in media is absolutely unjustified.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, according to Politico, European Commission Vice President warned of a Brexit deal ‘collapse’ if the UK exits Northern Ireland (NI) Protocol.</p>
<p>From other news, US jobless claims were released today, showing a decline to 198,000 from 206,000 the week before. At the same time, continuing claims improved to 1.716 million, down from 1.856 million previously. But, unfortunately, the greenback was unable to benefit from those numbers.</p>
<h2>Short-term appears bullish</h2>
<p>The next resistance for bulls will likely be at 1.36, where previous lows are located. We could see another leg higher if the pair jumps above that level, targeting the 200-day moving average (green line) at 1.3740.</p>
<p>It looks like the USD could slip further as several USD pairs are breaking upside from their recent ranges.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the support could be located in the 1.3420 region, and as long as the GBP trades above it, the short-term outlook seems bullish.</p>

<Title>SP500 trades near all-time highs</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The SP500 index traded half a percent higher ahead of the US session, climbing to the 4,800 USD level again and flirting with its all-time highs at 4,810 USD.</p>
<p>JP Morgan confirmed its overall bullish bias for SP 500 in its latest strategy report. The US bank used technical analysis and spotted some risk catalysts to suggest further advances of the key US equity index.</p>
<p>The SP 500 Index continues in a relatively low volatility bull market. They expect those conditions to dominate the first half of next year, albeit at a slightly lower rate of change. Additionally, they suggest using short- to medium-term risk-off periods to add to long exposure.</p>
<span class="quote-author">In our view, the 4430-4465 Sep-Oct pattern breakout and other nearby support levels mark a new floor,</span>
<span class="post-quote">JP Morgan concluded.</span>
<h2>Seasonal pattern in January</h2>
<p>From other news, there is a saying in the markets: "As January goes, so goes the rest of the year.", also known as the January Barometer. Since 1928, the SP500 has had 93 occasions to test the January Barometer, and in 64 of those years, the market did close the year in the direction that January set. By comparison, all other months, on average, were significantly less likely to be as well correlated as January.</p>
<p>Although this Barometer failed to work in 2021, it might work this year (statistically speaking). Therefore, if the market continues to rip higher this month, the whole year could be bullish.</p>
<p>Later today, the US Markit manufacturing PMI for December is due, along with construction spending data for November. Both numbers will unlikely move the markets.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the light resistance is expected in the 4,800 - 4,810 USD area. Once broken, we might see another leg higher, targeting the psychological threshold of 5,000 USD.</p>
<p>The midterm support is slightly above 4,700, where previous highs are located. So as long as the index trades above that level, the medium-term outlook seems bullish.</p>
<p>The 200-day average currently stands at 4,400 USD, and it has not been tested since June 2020, sounding an alarm over the overextension of the market. But, till now, it has been ignored.</p>

<Excerpt>Another day, another bullish session. US equities continue to rise and new record highs will likely be set soon.</Excerpt>

<Title>Bitcoin (BTC/USD ) statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>2.70%</strong>
 and <strong>-2.51%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>1.42%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.18%</strong>
. Yesterday’s return was <strong>-1.02%</strong>
, which is below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently negative (<strong>-2</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-1</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
, which means that we estimate the declining phase of the cycle. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. According to the long-term MA, <strong>BTC/USD</strong>
 is still in a bullish sentiment. However, the short-term and medium-term MAs may present resistance to market price.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the creation of the last all-time high, we have witnessed more downward trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>4</strong>
 consecutive days. However, the maximum decrease was <strong>6</strong>
 days in the measured period. The upward trend in recent weeks have not exceeded more than <strong>3</strong>
 days. The maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>8</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>6.42%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>4.41%</strong>
, which is below average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-6.00%</strong>
 and <strong>7.00%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>12.00%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/220103_lh_ac87baa3ec.jpg" alt="BTC/USD daily low to high distribution">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>After a dynamic decline in early December, basic technical analysis still supports short-term bearish sentiment. <strong>BTC/USD</strong>
 is currently again very close to the long-term moving average and the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>38.20%</strong>
. The price is still below the short-term MA. If the market price tests the last lows in December, it could gain support at the psychological level of <strong>40 000</strong>
, where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50.00%</strong>
. Further down is the important demand zone (green rectangle). However, in the case of growth, the level to be overcome is <strong>56 000</strong>
.</p>

<Title>EUR/USD slides below 1.13 amid rising US yields</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The USD continued to firm on Tuesday as rising US yields helped keep the greenback in demand. At the time of writing, the EUR/USD pair dropped below 1.13, completely erasing last week’s gains.</p>
<p>January kicked off negatively for US bonds, as traders continued to sell bonds, increasing their yields. As a result, the two-year yield rose above 0.8% for the first time since March 2020.</p>
<p>At the same time, the 10-year US yield jumped beyond the 1.6% mark, while the 30-year yield managed to rise above the 2% threshold.</p>
<h2>Hawkish Fed expectations</h2>
<p>The market now expects the Fed to raise rates in Q1, while two more rate hikes are seen as very likely in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>According to economists at DBS Bank, the US dollar is likely to be supported into the two Fed hikes they expect in 4Q22. The US dollar appreciation in 2022 will be less aggressive and choppier than that seen in the second half of 2021.</p>
<span class="quote-author">Based on past experiences, we expect the DXY to strengthen into the first Fed hike and depreciate after that, 
</span>
<span class="post-quote">they added.</span>
<h2>European data in focus</h2>
<p>Elsewhere, German retail sales accelerated to 0.6% month-on-month, against expectations of a decline from 0.5% to -0.5%. On the other hand, the yearly change remained at -2.9%.</p>
<p>Additionally, in December, the German unemployment rate ticked lower to 5.2% (from 5.3% previously), while the unemployment change improved to -23,000, from -34,000 in November.</p>
<p>At the same time, inflation in France decreased slightly in the last month of 2021, according to the preliminary data. As a result, the monthly CPI halved to 0.2%, but the yearly change stood unchanged at 3.4%.</p>
<p>Later today, the ISM manufacturing PMI for December will be released, forecast to decelerate mildly to 60.1, down from 61.1 previously. The inflation subindex will likely decline too.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the intraday support seems to be in the 1.1260 area. Still, it looks like the euro will decline to December lows in the 1.12 region. If we see a breakdown below that level, it might hit some large stop-losses, likely pushing the single currency quickly toward the psychological 1.10 level.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the euro needs to climb above 1.13 to stabilize short-term, while the resistance remains in the 1.1380 area.</p>

<Title>USD/JPY hovers near five-year highs</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The greenback erased more than half of yesterday’s gains during the London session, bringing USD/JPY below 116 and retreating from the highest level since January 2017.</p>
<p>Rising US yields have brought the pair sharply higher over the recent weeks as traders are pricing in three rate hikes by the Fed this year. As a result, the two-year yield surged above 0.8% for the first time since March 2020.</p>
<h2>US data in focus</h2>
<p>From other news, the December’ US Manufacturing PMI dropped more than expected yesterday and came out at 58.7, down from 61.1 previously. Economists had forecast 60.0. Additionally, the prices paid subindex decelerated sharply to 68.2, from 82.4 previously, suggesting inflation pressures in the manufacturing sector might be finally easing.</p>
<p>Later today, the ADP employment report for December is due, and investors expect the US economy to have created 400,000 new jobs, down from 534,000 set in November.</p>
<p>Moreover, the FOMC minutes from the December Fed's meeting will be released, likely confirming the central bank's hawkish stance. As a result, volatility in the financial markets could be elevated after the Minutes.</p>
<h2>BoJ remains dovish</h2>
<p>Reuters reported that at its next monetary policy meeting on January 17-18, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will likely make upward revisions to its inflation forecast for 2022-2023 due to rising energy costs, citing sources with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p>Easing supply constraints and an expected boost from the government's stimulus package may also lead to an upgrade in the BoJ's growth projection for next fiscal year.”
The central bank expects the Japanese economy to grow by 2.9% next fiscal year after this year's 3.4% expansion.
Additionally, December’s Japanese consumer confidence index was released today, showing a marginal decrease to 39.1 from 39.2 in the previous month.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the key support now stands at previous cycle highs at 115.50, and it looks like it will be tested pretty soon. If the pair drops below that support, it could be a strong bearish reversal signal, likely bringing the USD back to the 114 region.</p>
<p>On the upside, it appears the next target for bulls will likely be at 118.50, where December 2016/January 2017 highs are. A break above that resistance could quickly send the USD to the psychological 120 threshold.</p>
<p>The pair now seems overbought, possibly resulting in a break below the mentioned support.</p>

<Title>Gold loses 1,800 USD after hawkish FOMC minutes</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>FOMC with direct impact</h2>
<p>Precious metals plunged sharply yesterday, with the bearish mood continuing today. Ahead of the US session, gold was down half a percent, falling below the psychological level of 1,800 USD. At the same time, silver cratered more than 2%, dropping to two-week lows at 22.30 USD.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the main driver of the financial markets was the FOMC minutes, which sounded even more hawkish than anticipated.</p>
<p>The minutes read: Participants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the economy, the labor market, and inflation, it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated. Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate.</p>
<p>It looks like the talk about balance sheet reduction has spooked the markets yesterday, as some of the FOMC members talked about the probability of when it might be appropriate to reduce the size of the balance sheet, thus pulling liquidity out of the market.</p>
<span class="quote-author">"In our view, Wednesday’s minutes increased the chances that the FOMC might be ready to reach a decision on the runoff process and issue new normalization principles in the second quarter, which could mean that runoff begins somewhat earlier than our standing assumption of Q4. However, we still expect the start of runoff will substitute for a quarterly hike so that the FOMC would still hike three times total in 2022 if runoff begins in Q3,"</span>
<span class="post-quote">Goldman Sachs’ Jan Hatzius commented on the minutes.</span>
<h2>Risky assets took the hit</h2>
<p>The markets’ reaction to these minutes was pretty straightforward - everything risky was sold-off, including stocks, commodities, commodity currencies, and even cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Bonds were also under severe selling pressure, pushing their yields sharply higher. The 10-year US yield advanced to 1.74%, testing the last year’s highs in that region, while the 2-year US yield jumped from 0.75% to 0.86% today.</p>
<p>As a result, gold was smashed lower, falling below the psychological level of 1,800 USD, where the 200-day moving average is also located. Failure to stay above that zone could prompt further selling, targeting 1,780 USD.</p>
<p>More volatility will surely hit the markets tomorrow, as December’s US labor market update is due. Judging from this week’s massive ADP report, we could see a firm NFP number, reinforcing the hawkish narrative, likely sending precious metals further lower.</p>

<Title>DAX remains weaker after US job market data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>German DAX was down for the third consecutive day on Friday, falling half a percent and trading at around 15,950 EUR after US labor market data.</p>
<h2>Expectations not matching the reality</h2>
<p>Expectations were huge heading into today’s job market update for December. However, the reality was harsh. Moments ago, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in December, 199,000 jobs were added, a huge miss to expectations of 400,000 and the lowest number since December 2020.</p>
<p>The November payrolls data was revised higher, rising 39,000 from 210,000 to 249,000. Still, the unemployment rate improved markedly, falling to 3.9% from 4.2% and below the estimate of 4.1%. At the same time, labor force participation remained at 61.9%.</p>
<p>Looking at wage growth, average hourly earnings rose 4.7%, which while down from the upward revised 5.1%, was well above the 4.2% expected.</p>
<p>The headline NFP number was feeble, but the labor market in general strengthened in December, as seen from the falling unemployment rate and rising wages. It should still be enough for the Fed to hike rates in March. The market-implied chance for that to happen has shot sharply higher to 90%.</p>
<span class="quote-author">This is a green light for March. The U3 unemployment rate plunged 0.3ppt to 3.9%, 0.4ppt below the Fed’s Q4 2021 estimate and only 0.4ppt above the Fed’s estimate for year-end 2022</span>
<span class="post-quote">Renaissance Macro's Neil Dutta said after the data.</span>
<p>Therefore, the initial reaction was in the risk-off regime, sending yields higher while stocks were retreating.</p>
<p>From other news, German industrial output dropped 0.2% in November, a sharp decrease from October's 2.4% gain.</p>
<p>This weakness was also seen in France, where industrial production fell 0.4% monthly in November, after climbing 0.9% in October.</p>
<h2>Daily charts points to more weakness</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, it looks like a perfect double top pattern on the daily chart, with the resistance near 16,300 EUR. That is a bearish reversal pattern, which could send the DAX notably lower over the next few days.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is a bearish divergence between the price and the MACD indicator, reinforcing the bearish view.</p>
<p>The first line of defense will likely be at 15,800 EUR, while the key support should be at the 200-day moving average at around 15,600 EUR.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if sentiment improved, the initial selling zone should be at 16,000 EUR, followed by the mentioned cycle highs near 16,300 EUR.</p>

<Title>Ethereum (ETH/USD) statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>3.74%</strong>
 and <strong>-3.46%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>1.95%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.66%</strong>
. Yesterday’s return was <strong>-3.17%</strong>
, which is below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently very negative (<strong>-3</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>-2</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
, which means that we estimate a very negative declining phase of the cycle. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/220109_cycles_825181aedd.jpg" alt="ETH/USD daily price indexation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. As we can see in the chart below, all <strong>ETH/USD</strong>
 MAs currently support bearish sentiment. In the case of growth, the annual MA may be the price resistance.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/220109_Mo_M_a0d44a8d62.jpg" alt="ETH/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since the creation of the last historical maximum, we have witnessed more declining trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>4</strong>
 consecutive days, which is also the maximum in the measured period. The upward trends in recent weeks have not exceeded more than <strong>3</strong>
 days. The maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>8</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>7.65%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>4.45%</strong>
, which is below average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-7.70%</strong>
 and <strong>8.80%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>13.50%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>After a dynamic decline in early December, basic technical analysis still supports short-term bearish sentiment as the market price creates lower low and lower highs. <strong>ETH/USD</strong>
 is currently very close to the psychological level of <strong>3 000</strong>
 and the level of Fibonacci retracement <strong>38.20%</strong>
. The price is also below short-term and long-term MAs. Recently entered the demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the level of Fibonacci retracement <strong>50.00%</strong>
 at the bottom. However, we can clearly see a bullish divergence between price development and the RSI. Therefore, we can expect a small stabilization in the zone before any dynamic movement.</p>

<Excerpt>Most cryptocurrencies began their recent decline after Wednesday´s FOMC meeting (we should be ready to raise rates relatively soon). Ethereum fell the most of the major cryptocurrencies. The current price of Ethereum / U.S. Dollar is 3 100 (January 09, 2021). Let’s now look at statistical and technical analysis.</Excerpt>

<Title>EUR/AUD fails at 200-day average</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The EUR/AUD cross jumped to the 200-day moving average last week, but that level has been defended by bears and the price dropped nearly half a percent on Monday.</p>
<h2>Australian situation is not so positive</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, Australian building permits jumped 3.6% month-on-month, but the yearly gauge declined notably to -7.7% from 3.1% in October.  Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison acknowledged on Monday, the highly-contagious Omicron coronavirus variant is having an impact on the country’s workforce and consumer spending.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the country’s Assistant Treasurer Michael Sukkar,  said that he is confident the Australian economy can overcome the Omicron challenge with households having the security of huge savings. Moreover, according to the recent CFTC data, net speculative positions on the Australian dollar remain the lowest since the 2020 COVID crash, possibly leading to a short-squeeze rally soon.</p>
<h2>EU data paint a negative picture as well</h2>
<p>In the Eurozone, Friday’s data showed that the CPI inflation rose again, jumping to the highest level ever during the euro time, printing 5% year-on-year, above the 4.7% expected.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the ECB remains oblivious, reiterating that it would not raise rates this year, still expecting inflation to ease soon. Judging from the recent inflation momentum, that does not look probable.</p>
<p>Additionally, Friday’s data showed that retail sales in the Eurozone improved notably from 0.3% to 1.0% on the monthly basis, with the yearly change soaring to 7.8% from 1.7% previously.</p>
<p>On the other hand, services sentiment crashed to 11.2 in December (from 18.3 in November) amid more lockdowns and restrictions in many EU countries. The consumer confidence also fell, printing -8.3, down from -6.8 in the previous month.</p>
<p>Today’s economic numbers informed market participants that the EU unemployment rate slid to 7.2% in November. Finally, the Sentix investor confidence improved to 14.9 from 13.5 scored in December.</p>
<p>Expectations were stabilizing at around the previous month's level due to the continued effects of supply bottlenecks and high inflation figures, Sentix Managing Director Patrick Hussy said.</p>
<p>As the AUD/USD pair remains in a steady uptrend since its December lows, but the EUR/USD pair trades with a slight bearish momentum stuck near 1.13, EUR/AUD could decline further over the following days.</p>

 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
, which means that we estimate a slightly negative phase of the cycle. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>

<p>In the last quarter of 2021, we witnessed more upward trends, with the maximum level reaching <strong>9</strong>

<p>Basic technical analysis still supports bullish sentiment as the market price creates higher highs and higher lows. The decline in recent days is nothing extra compared to the price development since the beginning of 2020. <strong>NASDAQ</strong>
 is currently located near the demand zone (green rectangle), where there are also the psychological level of <strong>15 000</strong>
 and the long-term moving average. The divergence between price development and RSI also supports the bullish scenario. Therefore, we could see an upward pullback before another potential decline.</p>

<Excerpt>The number of NASDAQ companies that have fallen by more than 50% from one-year highs is extreme compared to historical data. Is something bigger coming? The current price of NASDAQ Composite is 15 614 (January 11, 2021). Let’s now look at statistical and technical analysis.</Excerpt>

<Title>USD/JPY snaps four-day losing streak</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The USD/JPY currency moved higher on Tuesday, rising 0.3% during the US session and trading at around 115.50. The latest correction from five-year highs led to a retest of the 115 handle, but bulls seem to have successfully defended it.</p>
<h2>Bank of Japan remains dovish</h2>
<p>Bank of Japan (BoJ) officials see price gains reaching near 2% in the second quarter on higher energy costs and supply-chain disruptions, MNI reported today.</p>
<p>With a fiscal stimulus kicking in and the output gap turning positive around mid-2022, BOJ is looking at wages and costlier consumer goods to more pressure, the report said.</p>
<p>At its next monetary policy meeting, scheduled for January 17 and 18, the BoJ may raise the 2022 inflation forecast to 1% or higher from the current 0.9%. However, monetary policy should remain ultra-lose. Thus, the yen might continue to weaken against the greenback.</p>
<h2>The Fed endures in hawkishness</h2>
<p>Later in the day, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify on the renomination to chair the Federal Reserve Board of Governors before Senate Banking Committee in Washington DC. His comments regarding monetary policy will be closely watched as the Fed has turned notably more hawkish than previously anticipated.</p>
<p>The NFIB Business Optimism Index for December and the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index for January will be featured in the US economic calendar.</p>
<p>US yields continue to be elevated, with the 10-year yield briefly rising above 1.8%, while the 2-year remained near 0.9% today, the highest level in two years.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, the critical support is near 115.10, and if broken to the downside, we could see a more significant correction toward 113.80. The MACD indicator also looks like it will send a bearish signal on the daily chart.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the first short-term target for bulls is at last week’s highs near 116.20, and if reached, we could see another leg higher toward 117.</p>

<Title>Can you read tokenomics data?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Tokenomics is <strong>an essential part of the world of cryptocurrencies (tokens),</strong>
 which should be understood, at least in the basics, by every experienced investor. It is usually explained in detail in the project documentation or in a document called the whitepaper and should give an idea of the functionality of the token. If the project has a poorly set tokenomics, which usually means that it does not match the project product, problems arise. These can often be fatal for company, and, of course, complications will not be missed by investors who hold the cryptocurrency. From the introductory sentences, it is probably clear why tokenomics is something you should understand. Today we will look at <strong>how to recognize and identify good and bad tokenomics of projects.</strong>
</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/220111_cryp_web_be62456b9e.jpg" alt="Business analyst working">
<span class="img-caption">Business analyst working, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>Correctly set tokenomics stimulates "good" user behaviour, and, conversely, inappropriate behaviour is suppressed. Under improper conduct, we can imagine, for example, a particular way of exploiting the ecosystem of the project to the detriment of other users. The created ecosystem should be beneficial for the project product itself and thus increase the token's attractiveness. Many tokenomic models do not meet these ideals. <strong>Probably the worst example is tokenomics, which is set up almost exclusively for the benefit of token makers.</strong>
 A key aspect is that design, along with greater token acceptance, must also bring more value.</p>
<h2>Pay attention to the most critical tokenomics metrics</h2>
<p>The most critical metrics for token and project valuation include <strong>total supply, market capitalization, and so-called Fully Diluted Value (FDV).</strong>
 This data is publicly available on most projects on portals such as Coinmarketcap or Coingecko.</p>
<p>Market capitalization is equal to the product of the supply in circulation and the price of a given token. <strong>It shows us how the project is valued by the market</strong>
 and can be a signal of growth potential as well as overestimation.</p>
<p><strong>The total supply represents the number of tokens already created</strong>
 from which the burned tokens are deducted. It should be noted that the total supply is not the same as the <strong>maximum supply, which represents the maximum possible number of units during the entire "lifetime" of the token.</strong>
 Indeed, some cryptocurrencies do not have a finite number of units (e.g. ETH), and investors know that new units may be entering the market, which of course, has a significant impact on price. However, not all ecosystems that do not have a fixed maximum supply must necessarily be perceived negatively. There are various mechanisms designed to slow down or stop the dilution of the supply.</p>
<p>The last metric we mentioned was <strong>the fully diluted value - FDV.</strong>
 This is equal to the total bid multiplied by the price and is <strong>essentially the market capitalization of the project if all tokens were in circulation.</strong>
 If the FDV is astronomically high compared to the market capitalization, it signals that there are still more tokens on the market. This can, of course, be very bad for the price of the token, as supply may enormously exceed demand in the future.</p>
<h2>Monitor token distribution and allocation</h2>
<p>These data relate mainly to the origin of the token and its distribution among the holders. It is important that this information is publicly known, showing that the project is straightforward in tokenomics and is not preparing for any scam practices. The distribution is <strong>usually displayed in the form of a pie chart, which simply shows how many tokens from the total supply are allocated in different categories.</strong>
 We mainly monitor the sale of tokens to early investors, public sale of tokens, rewards for staking or liquidity providers, as well as rewards to the team.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/220111_cryp_web3_3588d9914c.jpg" alt="Business analyst working">
<span class="img-caption">Business analyst working, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>Some projects have a <strong>gradual release of tokens to the market,</strong>
 so investors do not have to worry about severe supply shocks when large numbers of new tokens enter the market at once. The ideal solution is <strong>locking in smart contracts,</strong>
 which are publicly available and can be checked relatively quickly. In addition, there is no way to bypass smart contracts, so we don't have to rely on project promises. In this way, for example, the tokens of early investors or the team are locked. It is these groups of holders who are most motivated to sell at the first price increase, as they obtained their tokens cheaper or even completely free (team).</p>
<h2>The best known token models</h2>
<p>In general, we could say that we know 2 basic models of tokens - <strong>tokens with a fixed supply and inflationary tokens.</strong>
 The difference is whether or not the token has a maximum supply.</p>
<p>As we have already explained, <strong>for tokens with a fixed maximum supply, the final maximum number of units is known.</strong>
 However, we can also observe some form of inflation which arises, for example, through a token release plan. In this situation, more tokens enter the market in a relatively short period of time, and if the process is not adequately matched to demand, it can cause the token price to drop sharply. For example, if a project offers very high (hundreds to thousands of per cent) levels of staking or liquidity rewards, be careful. These rewards can attract a large number of users, who will then be motivated to sell quickly.</p>
<p>The second model is the so-called <strong>inflationary tokens, which do not have a final maximum supply.</strong>
 An excellent example of this model is the second-largest cryptocurrency Ethereum <strong>(ETH), where new units are created along with each mined block.</strong>
 However, we mentioned above that cryptocurrencies without a limited maximum supply do not have to be something bad, and nor is ETH. Its developers are creating various <strong>deflationary mechanisms</strong>
 in the ecosystem that should turn Ether into a deflationary cryptocurrency in the future.</p>
<p>For example, there is a demanding process of transition from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and only recently an update called EIP-1559 has been implemented. It ensures that part of the transaction fees is burned in each transaction, which hampers the inflation process. <strong>In the event that such ETH burning precedes the creating of new units, we can speak of a deflationary cryptocurrency.</strong>
 In connection with the growing adoption, this will also have a positive effect on the price of ETH, and it is here that the value of the cryptocurrency (token) is closely linked to other aspects of tokenomics.</p>
<h2>Token Utility</h2>
<p>Finally, we come to probably the most important part of tokenomics, which is the usefulness of the token in the ecosystem of the whole project. We can imagine a project that has a <strong>great product, but the token is not directly integrated into its operation. Thus, the product's value is not transferred to such token</strong>
, and its price will not be positively affected even if the product is successful. The opposite extreme is <strong>companies without any exciting product, which often push their token price up only through marketing and hype.</strong>
 This is one of the reasons why experienced investors warn the market about investing in tokens, such as various memecoins, which often arise as a joke. You always have to ask yourself what the token is for. Does it bring any benefit? Does it come with any added value? Will it be used in the future? Is this token interesting for a large number of users?</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/220111_cryp_web1_9369d17e89.jpg" alt="Analyser Examining Graph On Computer ">
<span class="img-caption">Analyst Examining Graph On Computer, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>If the use of a token in a project is set up correctly, it is likely that it will <strong>be able to catch more product value,</strong>
 attract more users to the project, and therefore more capital. Consequently, it is in the best interest of each project to ensure that their token is usable.</p>
<p>There are many tokens (cryptocurrencies) that are used, for example, to pay for transactions on a given blockchain or to pay for a service that is hosted on a blockchain. This brings a <strong>natural form of demand because people need this token to actually do what they want to do</strong>
 (pay for the transaction or use some service).</p>
<p>Another form of value that a token can take on is <strong>project management and decision-making on important aspects of company development.</strong>
 In these cases, the token is used to vote on the next steps in the project. By holding tokens, users can vote, for example, on implementations of community-created proposals or on the release of new tokens.</p>
<p>The last helpful feature we will imagine is <strong>using tokens for staking. It allows users to lock their tokens for a period of time and earn a specific return for that activity.</strong>
 Part of the token offer will be withdrawn from the market. Most staking mechanisms are designed to make the blockchain more robust, and others are <strong>used exclusively to generate new tokens.</strong>
 The form of staking is also interesting, in which the income from a given product is redistributed to these users. For example, in the decentralized exchange SushiSwap thus receives a percentage of the generated fees on the exchange.</p>
<h2>Let's get over it one more time</h2>
<p>As you already know, tokenomics plays a crucial role in crypto projects and literally determines a company's future success or failure. <strong>Even great project with the best product can fail if the incentives from the tokenomics are not in line with that product and if the tokenomics fails to reflect the growing usage of the product.</strong>
</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/220111_cryp_web2_68e96bb72c.jpg" alt="Business analyst working">
<span class="img-caption">Business analyst working, Source: shutterstock.com</span>
<p>On the other hand, you have to <strong>be very careful about projects without any product, service or added value</strong>
 that will be of interest to many users. If the project only has a management token without any other use cases, the benefit may be limited. <strong>The token should simply capture as much of the value of the product or service as possible.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Also, pay attention to projects with unclear token distribution, as well as those in which most tokens are owned by early investors or a team,</strong>
 and it is not predetermined how new units will be released to the market. Tokenomics is a relatively complex discipline, but knowing these basics will make you better at avoiding bad investments.</p>

<Title>Gold struggles despite highest US inflation in four decades</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The bullion failed to post any gains following the highest inflation in forty years.</p>
<h2>Inflation still rising</h2>
<p>Today’s US inflation data were of significant importance. First, the CPI met expectations, printing 7% year-on-year, the highest since June 1982. That was the 19th straight monthly rise in CPI inflation.</p>
<p>At the same time, the core CPI also surged and reachest the highest level since February 1991 (printing hotter than expected at +5.5% yearly).</p>
<p>Shelter inflation rose to 4.13% YoY, up from 3.84%, the highest since February 2007 (the bubble that took down the global economy).</p>
<p>Finally, services inflation jumped to 3.7% - its highest since January 2007 - goods inflation soared 10.7% YoY - its highest since May 1975.</p>
<p>Inflation data practically confirmed that the Fed would hike rates in March. However, volatility was low after the release, with stocks spiking, dollar and yields falling slightly. Still, gold barely moved and remained anchored near 1,820 USD.</p>
<h2>Is Fed finally going to step up?</h2>
<p>Yesterday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell confirmed the hawkish shift at the central bank with the following statement to the US Senate.</p>
<span class="quote-author">“If we see inflation persisting at higher levels, longer than expected, if we have to raise interest rates more over time, then we will.”
</span>
<span class="post-quote">Jerome Powell</span>
<p>It is worth noting that the Fed’s Chief stated that the Federal Reserve should focus more on elevated prices than on achieving the maximum employment goal. Several months ago, he kept reiterating to everyone that inflation was only transitory. Remember?</p>
<h2>What is gold doing?</h2>
<p>So far, gold has managed to stay above 1,800 USD, where the 200-day moving average also is. As long as the precious metal trades above that level, the short-term outlook appears bullish.</p>
<p>However, the medium and long-term trends remain neutral as gold has not moved anywhere in more than a year.  The resistance should be expected at 1,835 USD; if broken to the upside, we might see a rally toward 1,865 USD. On the downside, a breakdown below 1,800 USD might lead to a decline to 1,780 USD. Rising US yields & strengthening US dollar should cap any upside potential in precious metals.</p>

<Title>S&P 500 ahead of the key period - what can happen?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>There are however other important events ahead. For instance, the inflation in US is the highest in 40 years and Fed will need to address this problem. That is also a reason why has Fed started to announce the interest rate hikes at the end of 2021.</p>
<p>According to the Fed, we can see at least three interest rate hikes by the end of 2022. There are also huge economic and political pressures to make this happen immediately after the end of tapering in March 2022. March can thus be crucial for the markets and the whole year 2022. One thus needs to ask, what can this mean for the charts?</p>
<h2>S&P 500 on 4h chart</h2>
<p>S&P 500 is one of the most important charts in the financial markets, which is a reason why we will take a closer look at it. In general, it can be said that indices and stocks do not perform well when it comes to interest rate hikes, and they rarely rise on this news. Most of the time they move downwards or sideways at best.</p>
<p>If we look at the 4 hour chart of S&P 500, we can see a huge rising wedge. The target in this wedge is a level of 4 858 – 4 890. We can also say that if we do not get under the support of 4 587 – 4 609, there is no need to worry about correction.</p>
<p>Yet, rising wedge is considered to be a reversing pattern and thus is viewed as a pattern that changes trends. One can then speculate whether this also about to happen with S&P 500.</p>

<span class="img-caption">4H chart of S&P 500</span>
<h2>Daily view - a reason to worry?</h2>
<p>Just a brief comment on the daily chart. We can see that ever since Covid-19 happened, S&P 500 has been doing incredibely well. And that is what I am afraid of. The rise we have seen was extraordinary and might be due for a correction.</p>

<span class="img-caption">1D view of S&P 500</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The first quarter of this year will be important for the whole 2022. Fed can no longer ignore the rising inflation and needs to adjust the interest rates accordingly.</p>

<Excerpt>The coming weeks will be crucial for the markets. Tapering means that by the end of March 2022 the quantitative easing will stop and that the markets will not get any newly printed money from the Fed.</Excerpt>

<Title>EUR/USD at two-month highs after US inflation data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The EUR/USD pair moved notably higher this week, jumping above the 1.1450 level for the first time since early November as traders sold the greenback following the US CPI report.</p>
<h2>Incompetent ECB?</h2>
<p>Earlier today, the ECB economic bulletin was released, saying that the exact impact of the Omicron covid variant on the economy is highly uncertain.</p>
<p>Euro area growth is moderating but expected to pick up again firmly this year. Risks to the economic outlook are broadly balanced, the bulleting continued. The impact on the EUR/USD pair was minimal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, European Central Bank (ECB) Vice President Luis de Guindos said on Thursday that the European economy is getting used to the coronavirus, as reported by Reuters. Additionally, he thinks that Perhaps inflation won't be as transitory as forecast only some months ago.</p>
<p>So for several months, they kept the printing press rumbling, saying that inflation would come down. Now, when every sane person knows it will not come down, they change their narrative, although showing no real action to stop the inflation from rising further.</p>
<h2>US inflation coming in hot</h2>
<p>From other news, investors focused on yesterday's CPI numbers. First, the CPI met expectations, printing 7% year-on-year, the highest since June 1982. That was the 19th straight monthly rise in CPI inflation.</p>
<p>At the same time, the core CPI also surged and reached the highest level since February 1991 (printing hotter than expected at +5.5% yearly).</p>
<p>Later in the day, the US PPI is due, expected to show another rise in inflation. The year-on-year gauge is seen rising to 9.8% from 9.6% previously, while the core PPI is forecast to advance from 7.7% to 8.0%. At the same time, monthly changes will likely decrease.</p>
<p>Additionally, initial jobless claims will be released, probably falling to 200,000 from 207,000 previously, while continuing claims are expected to improve notably to 1.733 million.</p>
<p>Lastly, Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard is due to testify on the nomination of Vice-Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors before the Senate Banking Committee in Washington DC.</p>
<p>On Friday, US retail sales for December are due, likely showing a slight decline, despite the holiday season. In addition, import/export price indices will also be released, along with the Michigan consumer sentiment index for January.
The next target for bulls will likely be at 1.1520. If the euro jumps above that level, the medium-term trend could change to bullish.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the support could be located in the 1.1380 zone. The short-term outlook appears positive as long as the pair trades above it.</p>

<Excerpt>The USD declined broadly as traders took their profits from the recent rally. It looks like the medium-term uptrend might be soon over for the USD.</Excerpt>

<Title>FTSE stays near 2-year highs after UK, US data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>On Friday, the FTSE index remained flat despite losses in other stock markets as bulls got some serious support from today’s UK econ numbers.</p>
<h2>UK data cheered by economists</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, investors paid attention to the UK GDP figures for November. According to the Office for National Statistics, the British economy recovered to above pre-pandemic levels in November.</p>
<p>GDP grew 0.9%, up from 0.2% in October and above expectations for 0.4% growth. That left the economy 0.7% above its level in February 2020, just before the first wave of the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said that the economy grew strongly in the month before Omicron struck with architects, retailers, couriers, and accountants having a bumper month. Construction also recovered from several weak months, as many raw materials became easier to get hold of.</p>
<span class="quote-author"> "This meant that monthly GDP exceeded its pre-pandemic level for the first time in November,"</span>
<span class="post-quote">he added.</span>
<p>Additionally, UK industrial production improved notably to 1% month-on-month in November, up from -0.5% in October. At the same time, manufacturing production also rose markedly to 1.1% (from 0.1% previously).</p>
<p>The FTSE index shot higher after the numbers but was dragged down shortly after amid the negative sentiment in US stocks.</p>
<h2>Terrible US data</h2>
<p>The focus then switched to US retail sales for December, which printed a -1.3% monthly decline, the most significant drop since February 2021.</p>
<p>Furthermore, retail sales ex-autos and gas plunged even more to -2.5% monthly. Worse still, the control group retail sales - used in the GDP calculations - crashed 3.1% month-on-month - massively below forecasts.</p>
<p>From other news, US capacity utilization ticked lower to 76.5% in December, against expectations of an improvement to 77% (from 76.6% in November). At the same time, industrial production fell to -0.1%, down from 0.7% previously.</p>
<p>Later in the session, the Michigan consumer sentiment survey for January is expected to ease slightly from 70.6 to 70.0. However, sentiment among consumers will likely continue to decline amid the soaring prices of everything.</p>
<p>The key resistance for the index now remains in the 7,700 GBP region, which was the double top formation heading into the COVID crash. If the index jumps above it, the medium-term target could be 8,000 GBP.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin holds 40 000 level – where do we go from here?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>What can we see at 4h chart?</h2>
<p>Looking at this chart we can see a nice bounce. Bitcoin has broken the trendline at the local level. We can also see a long wick at the bottom. Such a long wick with such a significant volumes can usually signify a bottom. As of now, it is absolutely crucial for us not to create a lower lows, which means that we should not go below 39 633 dollars. If we keep these values, there is a huge probability that Bitcoin can attack 45 429 – 46 493 USD levels in the coming days.</p>
<p>However, I am not very hopeful when it comes to bigger movements. If Bitcoin shoots above these levels, I will be closing my longs and waiting for the reaction. This area was our support for the whole December and right now serves as a strong resistance. I do not believe that Bitcoin will be so strong as to go above it in one go.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/2_Bitcoin_4h_d967da7ca3.png" alt="Bitcoin 4h chart">
<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin 4h chart</span>
<h2>What does the overall trend say?</h2>
<p>The number one priority now is to hold 40 000 dollars mark. I believe that the coming days will show that we can hold this level. Yet, I am not really sure if we can hold this level also in coming months. Looking at daily chart, we are still below the trendline and we have not seen any significant pullback. We have been in a downward trend for more than 2 months.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has been falling a lot, but the selling pressures seem to be getting weaker.  The biggest sells of Bitcoin in December were probably coming from China, but this has already stopped. The support of 40 000 dollars is very strong and I reckon we can hold it for a bit longer. In the coming weeks I expect the following, as shown at the chart. The priority is still to hold the 40 000 dollars level.</p>

<Title>AUD/USD defends bullish channel</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The Australian dollar traded somewhat higher Monday, following some Chinese macro data. At the time of writing, the AUD/USD pair was spotted changing hands near 0.7215.</p>
<h2>Chinese data in focus</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, <strong>China unexpectedly cut interest rates for the first time since 2020 to counter the economic slowdown in the country</strong>
. The Chinese move has prompted speculation that the current global monetary policy tightening will be short-lived, sending stocks, metals, and commodity-linked currencies higher.</p>
<p>Additionally, Chinese GDP slowed to 4% year-on-year in the last quarter of 2021, down from 4.9% previously. On the other hand, the quarterly change grew notably at 1.6%, up from 0.2% in the third quarter.</p>
<p>At the same time, <strong>Chinese industrial production improved to 4.3% yearly, up from 3.8% in November</strong>
. Lastly, <strong>retail sales more than halved from 3.9% to 1.7% in December</strong>
.</p>
<p>After the mixed data, the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) head Ning Jizhe said that China expects the operation of its property market to keep pace with steady growth of investment in the sector this year. However, he also added that there was room for monetary policy to support growth.</p>
<p>During the US session, banks will be closed due to Martin L. King's Birthday bank holiday, likely resulting in thin liquidity (and low volatility) throughout the rest of the day.</p>
<h2>Steady uptrend on daily chart</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, the pair has been in a steady uptrend since its December lows, and bulls are still defending the lower bound of the channel. Thus, the short-term support seems to be in the 0.72 region.</p>
<p>However, if the <strong>Aussie drops down from the channel, we could see further selling pressure, targeting 0.7170 or 0.71.</strong>
</p>
<p>On the other hand, should the bullish momentum prevail, the Australian dollar might rally toward 0.7250, with the key resistance spotted near 0.7320.</p>
<h2>HSBC bullish on AUD</h2>
<p><strong>One of the large investment banks - HSBC - has recently stated a bullish view on the Aussie.</strong>
</p>
<p>The AUD has benefited from sizeable current account surpluses over the past few quarters, helped by a surge in commodity prices. This is unlikely to change in the coming quarters, as export growth should remain strong, supported by high commodity prices; China’s policy shift to boost growth and stabilization in global growth slowdown. All this should continue to support the AUD.</p>
<span class="quote-author">Some of these positive catalysts may not kick in more meaningfully until later this year. However, the AUD may still struggle over the near term, given its vulnerability to swings in risk appetite as the Federal Reserve nears its first rate hike with the need to tap the inflation brakes in focus,</span>
<span class="post-quote">the bank added. </span>

<Title>GBP/JPY slides after BoJ, UK data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The GBP/JPY cross moved lower Tuesday, despite the overall JPY weakness in the FX market after the latest BoJ meeting.</p>
<h2>Dovish BoJ, as always</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, the Bank of Japan left monetary policy unchanged and sounded somewhat dovish, failing to live up to the recent hawkish expectations.</p>
<p><strong>The Bank of Japan’s Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated that the central bank would ease policy further without hesitation as needed. However, he also said that the central bank is not considering rate hikes or tweaking current monetary easing.</strong>
</p>
<p>Thus, the Bank of Japan remains committed to lower interest rates if necessary until 2% inflation is met.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>Japanese industrial production eased slightly from 7.2% to 7.0% month-on-month. At the same time, the yearly change also weakened and printed 5.1% in November, down from 5.4% previously</strong>
. On the other hand, capacity utilization was up in November to 8%, from 6.2% in October.</p>
<h2>UK labor market data fail to support GBP</h2>
<p>Data released earlier by the Office for National Statistics showed that the UK unemployment rate improved as firms hired more people despite the soaring Omicron variant.</p>
<p><strong>In December, the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, from 4.2% previously</strong>
. The claimant count change rose from -95,100 to -43,300. There were 29.5 million payrolled employees in the UK in December, up 184,000 from November and 409,000 higher than in February 2020.</p>
<p>On the other hand, <strong>wage growth in the three months to November fell to 3.8% year-on-year from 4.3% in the previous month.</strong>
</p>
<p>From other news, according to the recent survey, over 37% of UK businesses don’t think they will survive due to Brexit, as UK’s Truss braces for key talks with EU’s Sefcovic.</p>
<h2>Daily chart seems slightly bearish</h2>
<p>It looks like the Pound has failed to reach previous highs in the 158 area, resulting in some profit-taking. <strong>Moreover, the MACD indicator has already sent a bearish signal, likely dragging the GBP further lower over the following days</strong>
. As long as the price trades below 158, bears could try to push the price lower, targeting 155.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the price shoots above 158, we might see a quick rally to 160.</p>
<p>The significant support is seen at 153, where the 200-day moving average (green line) is. A breakdown below that level could send sterling toward 150.</p>

<Title>Palladium (XPD/USD) statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h1>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</h1>
<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.48%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.54%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.75%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.71%</strong>
. Yesterday´s return was <strong>-0.13%</strong>
, well below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>3</strong>
 for price indexation. It is currently in a very positive phase of the cycle. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/220118_cycles_1d85a2397b.jpg" alt="XPD/USD daily price indexation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. The <strong>XPD/USD</strong>
 rose again above the short-term MA this week. Therefore, as we can see in the chart below, only medium and long-term MAs currently support bearish sentiment.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/220118_Mo_M_ea9ef21d0d.jpg" alt="XPD/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our <a href="https://investro.com/commodities/xpd-usd-statistical-and-technical-analysis-5">last analysis</a>
, we have witnessed several upward trends (even the price is lower) with the maximum level reaching <strong>5</strong>
 consecutive days. The maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>14</strong>
 days. However, the downward trends have not exceeded more than <strong>4</strong>
 days in the last period. However, the maximum in the measured period is <strong>6</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.58%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>2.19%</strong>
, which is well below average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-3.0%</strong>
 and <strong>3.0%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>5.25%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<h1>TECHNICAL ANALYSIS</h1>
<p>The basic technical analysis points to a short-term uptrend after rebounding from the psychological level of <strong>1 600</strong>
. However, the market price is currently in the demand zone (green rectangle), where is also the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>23.60%</strong>
, along with a short-term moving average, which could support the price. In addition, the bulls were motivated by the divergence between price developments and the RSI created in late September and mid-December.</p>

<Title>FTSE shoots higher despite soaring inflation</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The British FTSE 100 index - also known as the Footsie - managed to erase most of yesterday’s losses and traded half a percent higher ahead of the US session, last seen climbing above 7,600 GBP.</p>
<h2>UK inflation worsens</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, <strong>UK inflation hit 30-year highs, rising to 5.4% year-on-year, up from 5.1% previously and above expectations of 5.2%</strong>
. The core gauge advanced further from 4.0% to 4.2%. In addition, the <strong>retail price index</strong>
 - measuring a weighted average of prices of a specified set of goods and services purchased by consumers and being widely considered a key measure of inflation that indicates an accurate reflection of the cost of living - <strong>jumped from 7.1% to 7.5% yearly.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Investors now anticipate with more than a 90% chance that the BoE will hike its primary interest rate to 0.5% at its next meeting in February</strong>
. Last month it became the world's first major central bank to tighten policy since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<span class="quote-author">The Bank of England was already feeling uncomfortable about its monetary policy stance. Today's upside surprises to both the headline and core inflation readings will certainly not have helped,</span>
<span class="post-quote">said Ambrose Crofton, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.</span>
<p>Later today, BoE Governor Andrew Bailey is due to testify, along with BOE Deputy Governor Jon Cunliffe, on the Bank of England Financial Stability Report before the Treasury Select Committee in London. There could also be questions regarding the soaring inflation and what the BoE plans to avert it.</p>
<p>From other “inflation news,” Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon complained of “wage inflation everywhere.” Inflation is indeed everywhere.</p>
<h2>Charts seem overbought</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, the index remains in a steep uptrend, supported by the trendline at around 7,550 GBP. If the price drops below it, the short-term outlook could change to bearish, with significant support at previous highs at 7,400 GBP. However, <strong>as long as FTSE trades above 7,400 GBP, the medium-term outlook still appears bullish.</strong>
</p>
<p>On the upside, the short-term resistance is at this week’s highs near 7,650 GBP, and if broken to the upside, a further rally above 7,700 GBP could occur.</p>
<p>However, it is essential to note that the daily chart (and also smaller time frames) look overbought, possibly leading to some profit-taking and a correction of the actual steep upward move.</p>

<Title>S&P 500 has broken down - will it follow falling NASDAQ?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h2>Nasdaq has lost 15 % from its ATH</h2>
<p>When we look at NASDAQ, one thing is clearly visible. We are now witnessing the biggest drawdown since march 2020.  This technology index has lost about 15 % from its ATH. What is even worse is the fact that the fall seems to be stronger now. Usually, the breakdowns start with sharp downward movement and then seem to slow down and gradually move to the side. That is not what we are seeing with NASDAQ. This index has firstly moved to the side and slowly started to decrease. As of now the falls are getting stronger and more significant.</p>
<p>Looking at the chart, I can see the closest support at around 175 – 177 points. But no one can rule out a possibility of even stronger breakdown below that level. Since March 2020 bottom NASDAQ increased in value by almost 200 % almost without any correction. So even a 30 – 40 % correction is still in line with usual movements of stock market due to the previous rise.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Daily chart of NASDAQ</span>
<h2>S&P 500 looks a bit better</h2>
<p>S&P 500 has lost about 5 % from its ATH, which is not a big deal, since S&P 500 rose at an incredible speed of 120 % since March 2020. It is thus possible to see 30 % drawdown even here without anyone worrying, since the index has been rising for 2 years without any correction. We have seen a few sharp downward movements, but most of them have been quickly brought back up to new ATH.</p>
<p>S&P 500 also fell below its structure and currently is creating lower highs and lower lows on a daily chart. This is a first sign of a change of trends. Yet, here it is not as critical as with NASDAQ. But we can see that this index is also starting to be a bit in trouble and I would not be surprised if it continues with the declines.</p>

<Excerpt>Both leading indices of US stock market, S&P 500 and NASDAQ, are not in the best shape. The fear of interest rate hikes by Fed is apparently slowly showing in the charts. We will thus look at both of these indices and try to see where they can be heading.</Excerpt>

<Title>AUD/USD jumps after solid jobs data</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Today, the Australian dollar advanced 0.3%, pushing the AUD/USD pair toward the 0.7250 level and returning into the upward channel.</p>
<h2>Domestic job market stays strong.</h2>
<p>The <strong>Australian employment change dropped notably in December, printing 64,800</strong>
, but it was more than double the expected amount of 30,000. The November reading stood at 366,000. At the same time, <strong>the unemployment rate improved markedly to 4.2% from 4.6% previously.</strong>
</p>
<p>Moreover, full-time employment decreased to 41,500 from 128,000, while part-time jobs came out at 23,300, down from 237,000 previously. The participation rate stayed unchanged at 66.1%.</p>
<p>Before that, the Westpac Consumer Confidence for January dropped to -2.0%, below -1.0% in December, whereas the Consumer Inflation Expectations dropped to 4.4% in January versus 4.8% previously.</p>
<h2>Chinese easing</h2>
<p>Additionally, the AUD has been supported by the recent People’s Bank of China move, as the <strong>Chinese central bank cut the one-year loan prime rate by 10-basis points to 3.70%</strong>
 at its January fixing. At the same time, <strong>the five-year rate was slashed by 5-basis points to 4.6% in January</strong>
. The five-year rate was cut for the first time since April 2020. In December 2021, the one-year rate was cut from 3.85% to 3.80%. So it looks like more easing will come.</p>
<p>During the US session, existing home sales for December are seen slowing somewhat. In addition, jobless claims will also be released, along with the Philadelphia fed manufacturing survey for January.</p>
<h2>Short-term seems bullish</h2>
<p>Technically speaking, the AUD/USD pair is back in its uptrend channel, with the recent breakdown below the trend line proving to be a bearish trap.</p>
<p><strong>As long as the Aussie stays within the channel, the short-term outlook seems bullish, with the next target probably in the 0.73 region, where this year’s highs are seen.</strong>
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the support will likely be found at this week’s lows near 0.7170. If not held, the Aussie might drop below 0.7150, possibly targeting the 0.71 threshold.</p>
<p>The USD has failed to capitalize on the rising yields recently, likely sending a bearish signal for the greenback as the rate hike cycle might be already priced in.</p>

<Title>Bitcoin has fallen below 40 000 USD - Whats coming next?</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin broke down pretty smoothly yesterday. I would not consider this a fake breakout, since it had everything it needed, a volume, vigour and close of 4h candle. Following that we have seen a candle that was not so strong. It all happened right at the time when S&P 500 started to dump, which probably also helped Bitcoin to push the price more downwards, to about 12 % drop. I honestly believe that this would not have happened if S&P 500 did not fall down.</p>
<h2>Daily chart</h2>
<p>Looking at the daily chart, I still have a clear goal and that is the rise of Bitcoin. This dump is pretty strong and does not seem to be slowing down, but I would not be entering short positions. Alts look really weak as well. This however seems to be the edge, when the reaction from Bitcoin has to come. For the past few weeks, Bitcoin has not done anything significant during the weekends and there has not been almost any volatility. It looks as if Bitcoin was only waiting and watching S&P 500. For the daily chart, however, I will be looking at these two possible price movements.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/4_Bitcoin_1_D_af200113fc.png" alt="Bitcoin 1D chart">
<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin 1D chart</span>
<h2>What to expect in coming hours?</h2>
<p>In the coming few hours we should be closely watching the levels of 36 639 – 38 108 USD. This is a support level where the dump has to be always reversed up and the buyers need to step in. I believe that during the weekend Bitcoin will slowly reach this price levels.</p>
<p>But I am not expecting any serious price movements, definitely not to upside. A lot will also depend on the situation around S&P 500 and its daily and weekly close, since S&P 500 is also at a support level. I mostly believe that the weekend will not bring any significant movement and we will only be waiting for Monday.</p>

<span class="img-caption">Bitcoin 4h chart</span>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I do not think that the situation is somehow critical yet. Obviously the 40 000 dollars was a strong support but we have not seen a sharp dump below it, since we are still pretty close to it. Near future movements will depend on todays close of indices, since they can dictate the price movement before the weekend.</p>

<Excerpt>Yesterday Bitcoin has fallen significantly below 40 000 USD. What does that change for the current market situation and what movements can be expected next? That is what we will look at today.</Excerpt>

<Title>Silver tags 200-day average</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Precious metals have had an extremely powerful week as both gold and silver rose sharply, with silver up more than 6% from this week’s lows, currently trading near 24.50 USD.</p>
<h2>Stubborn inflation & weak US macro figures</h2>
<p>On Thursday, <strong>initial jobless claims worsened sharply to 286,000, up from the last week's 231,000</strong>
. Continuing claims also rose and printed 1.635 million, against 1.551 million a week ago.</p>
<p>Existing home sales also failed to meet estimates and plunged 4.65 month-on-month to 6.18 million. So it looks like rocketing home prices might be deterring people from buying.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey improved more than expected in January, rising to 23.2 from 15.4 in December.</p>
<p>Thursday's gains in silver were really strong, despite Janet Yellen, the US Treasury chief, sounding a positive note on the inflation outlook for the year ahead, indicating that it might fall sharply should the pandemic be brought under control.</p>
<p><strong>Traders now expect the Fed to start the lift-off in March, with three more rate hikes priced in for the rest of the year.</strong>
</p>
<p>Despite rising interest rates, the USD seems to be struggling as the dollar index is about to decline below its long-term uptrend line. Should that happen, it could be a major bullish impetus for both silver and gold.</p>
<h2>Impressive technical situation on daily chart</h2>
<p>The metal has managed to jump above the long-term bearish trend line for the first time since June. <strong>That could mean the long-term downtrend might be over.</strong>
</p>
<p>Now it is facing another <strong>massive resistance at the 200-day moving average near 24.70 USD</strong>
. The last two times silver had rallied to this average, a sharp sell-off occurred. Therefore, it must jump above that level to confirm the bullish momentum.</p>
<p>In that case, the next target could be at November highs near 25.40 USD. Once the metal is above that zone, the long-term outlook could change to bullish.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the support seems near 23.90 - 24.00 USD zone, where the broken trend line is converged with previous highs and lows. Silver must stay above it for the bullish momentum to persist.</p>

<Title>Platinum (XPT/USD) statistical and technical analysis</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<h1>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</h1>
<p>Based on a long-term analysis of historical data, the average positive and negative daily returns are approximately <strong>1.04%</strong>
 and <strong>-1.08%</strong>
, respectively. The estimated daily return in both directions based on their probability of occurrence is <strong>0.53%</strong>
 and <strong>-0.51%</strong>
. Friday´s return was <strong>-0.99%</strong>
, which below the first standard deviation. Our scoring is currently neutral (<strong>0</strong>
) for the month-on-month change and <strong>0</strong>
 for price indexation. Both scorings range from <strong>-3</strong>
 up to <strong>3</strong>
 and are currently in the extreme of an ascending phase of the cycle. The development of the estimated cycles based on our analytical system is shown in the following chart.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/220123_Mo_M_ac4feab2f2.jpg" alt="XPT/USD daily price indexation">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Different moving averages (MAs) help us better identify trends across multiple time frames. We use 3 basic MAs to find out which sentiment dominates each horizon. The purple line represents the <strong>monthly</strong>
, the green line the <strong>6 months</strong>
 and the yellow line the <strong>annual</strong>
 moving average. As we can see in the chart below, bearish sentiment currently only supports long-term MA. In the event of a decline, monthly and 6-month MAs can be the price support.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.investro.com/images/medium/220123_cycles_8f748fdef2.jpg" alt="XPT/USD daily price development">
<span class="img-caption">Source: WALFIR</span>
<p>Since our <a href="https://investro.com/commodities/xpt-usd-statistical-and-technical-analysis-5">last analysis</a>
, we have witnessed more upward trends. They did not exceed <strong>4</strong>
 days. The total maximum in the measured period (last 3 years) is <strong>6</strong>
 days. Downward trends did not exceed more than <strong>2</strong>
 days in the same period. However, the total maximum for the last 3 years is <strong>7</strong>
 days. We could use the average long-term ATR (Average True Range) obtained from daily data (<strong>3.10%</strong>
) to estimate Stop Loss orders for our positions. The current value is <strong>3.27%</strong>
, which is almost average. Approximately <strong>90%</strong>
 confidence interval (return between <strong>-2.40%</strong>
 and <strong>2.40%</strong>
) is shown in the histogram below by a red rectangle.</p>

<p>We could use the last decile of low to high returns (<strong>3.60%</strong>
) to estimate Profit Targets, as shown in the chart below.</p>

<h1>TECHNICAL ANALYSIS</h1>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the basic technical analysis has supported bullish sentiment, as <strong>XPT/USD</strong>
 have dynamically rebounded from an important area of the demand zone (green rectangle), where are the Fibonacci retracement level of <strong>50.00%</strong>
 and the psychological level of <strong>1 000.00</strong>
. However, the market price is currently testing the long-term moving average along with the <strong>38.20%</strong>
 Fibonacci retracement level. In addition, there is a divergence between the price development and the RSI created since November.</p>

<Excerpt>Platinum bounced up dynamically last week, as did other precious metals. It is above the important zone again. The current price of XPT/USD – Platinum Spot US Dollar is 1 029 (January 21, 2021). Let us therefore now turn to statistical and technical analyzes.</Excerpt>

<Title>EUR/GBP advances amid GBP weakness post PMIs</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>Volatility has returned to the FX markets, reflecting the continuous sell-off in equities, benefitting the USD while undermining growth currencies such as AUD or NZD.</p>
<h2>EU data mixed</h2>
<p>In Europe, the preliminary January PMI data showed that the German manufacturing sector expanded notably to 60.5, from 57.4 previously, while the services sector returned above 50.0 and printed 52.2, up from 48.7 in December.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the mood in French sectors worsened, pushing both the PMIs lower month-on-month. The overall EU PMIs also decreased - showing a divergent picture yet again as Germany managed to improve its business, while on the other hand, the weaker EU countries fell further.</p>
<p>The <strong>UK PMI data was released later. The manufacturing survey fell from 57.9 to 56.9. The services PMI slid from 53.6 to 53.3. Both numbers came out below expectations.</strong>
</p>
<span class="quote-author">A resilient economic growth rate in the UK during January masks wide variations across different sectors. Consumer-facing businesses have been hit hard by Omicron, and manufacturers have reported a further worrying weakening of order book growth. Still, other business sectors have remained encouragingly robust,</span>
<span class="post-quote">explained Chris Williamson, Chief Business Economist at IHS Markit. </span>
<p>From other news, Germany's Bundesbank released its monthly report, noting that the <strong>German economy likely shrunk in the last quarter of 2021</strong>
. Furthermore, regarding the inflation outlook, Bundesbank said that <strong>price pressures could remain exceptionally high in early 2022 due to surging energy costs.</strong>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the ECB continues to stick its head into the sand, repeating it would not raise rates this year - despite other major central banks tightening their monetary policies notably.</p>
<h2>US data deteriorate</h2>
<p>From the US data, the <strong>US Markit manufacturing PMI for January dropped to 55 from 57.7 in December, according to the preliminary data. Likewise, the services survey crashed, even more, printing 50.9, down sharply from 57.6 previously.</strong>
</p>
<p>So it looks like the US economy is slowing notably, but the Fed is about to hike rates. Unfortunately, that could not end well.</p>
<h2>Daily trend neutral, short-term oversold</h2>
<p>Regarding the technical analysis, economists at ING expect the pair to break below 0.83 as the Bank of England (BoE) will hike rates at its next meeting in February.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it seems that the bearish momentum is exhausted, pushing the EUR/GBP cross higher over the last two days, as sentiment in the markets has deteriorated. The next resistance could be in the 0.84750 level, where previous lows are, while the critical level to watch is at the 200-day moving average near 0.8525.</p>

<Title>UK yields surge amid ongoing bond sell-off</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>British yield followed the US ones higher today, pushing the 10-year yield toward 1.205 again, while the 2-year yield jumped to its cycle highs slightly below the psychological 1% threshold.</p>
<h2>UK public finance data</h2>
<p>Earlier in the day, the <strong>Office for National Statistics showed that UK government borrowing fell more than expected in December thanks to improved tax revenues.</strong>
</p>
<p>Public sector net borrowing, excluding state banks, fell by 7.6 billion GBP year-on-year in December to 16.8 billion GBP, way below expectations of 18.5 billion GBP, as tax receipts rose. That was the fourth-highest December borrowing figure since monthly records began in 1993.</p>
<p>Tax receipts were up 6.2 billion GBP yearly, while government spending declined 1 billion GBP to 86.7 million GBP. At the same time, interest payments rose by 5.4 billion GBP year-on-year to 8.1 billion GBP in December.</p>
<p>As for the start of the new financial year, Britain has borrowed 146.8 billion GBP, down 129.3 billion GBP from the same period a year ago.</p>
<span class="quote-author">Public sector net borrowing in December was broadly in line with the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecast from last October. But, with inflation set to keep pushing higher until April, borrowing is likely to return to overshooting the OBR’s forecast in the coming months,
</span>
<span class="post-quote">Bethany Beckett, the UK economist at Capital Economics, said.</span>
<h2>Focus on Fed & BoE</h2>
<p>The US Federal Reserve begins its two-day policy meeting today. Although no changes to monetary policy are expected, <strong>the following statement, dot plot, and any additional information regarding rate hikes and the balance sheet reduction will be crucial for investors.</strong>
</p>
<p>Should the outcome of this meeting sound hawkish, we might see further stress in the global bond markets, likely sending yields further higher.</p>
<p>Alternatively, considering the recent losses in equities, the <strong>Fed might choose the wording very carefully in a dovish way. In that case, we might see a relief rally both in stocks and bonds, pushing their yields lower.</strong>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Bank of England is expected to raise rates at its February meeting, likely causing further selling pressure in the short-term bonds. Therefore, the 2-year yield might advance toward the 1% level. <strong>That level was last seen in 2011 - representing 11-year highs.</strong>
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the support for the yield could be at 0.8%, and as long as it remains above it, the uptrend appears intact.</p>

<Title>Nasdaq flies ahead of FOMC verdict</Title>
<Content><![CDATA[<p>The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index soared Wednesday, trading nearly 4% stronger during the London session, completely erasing yesterday’s sharp losses.</p>
<h2>Focus on Fed</h2>
<p>Later today, the Fed delivers the decision on monetary policy. There should not be any changes, and the central bank will likely confirm that the lift-off will begin in March. However, the discussion regarding the balance sheet reduction will be crucial.</p>
<p>Considering the recent crash in US stock markets, the Fed might sound somewhat dovish when talking about the balance sheet run-off in an effort to stabilize the markets.</p>
<span class="quote-author">This year’s sell-off in US indices has largely priced in the tightening path ahead with the potential for stocks to stabilize from here. Fed Chair Powell, who has been described as ‘Goldilocks in a suit,’ will be treading a fine line, neither too hawkish nor too dovish, displaying credibility in the fight against inflation without spooking the current precarious market mood,</span>
<span class="post-quote">Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said</span>
<p>Still, the US yields trade near their cycle highs, with the 10-year yield spotted slightly below 1.8%, while the 2-year yield advanced above the 1% psychological level, putting further pressure on risk assets, such as stocks.</p>
<p>The markets are currently expecting three to four rate hikes in 2022, as reflected by the fed funds futures.</p>
<h2>Volatility continues</h2>
<p>The daily chart looked really oversold. Thus, a relief rally was bound to happen, but this buying pressure is intensive, surprising many investors.</p>
<p>If the index closes above previous lows in the 14,460 USD area, we might have seen the bottom yesterday, with a possible strong rally toward the 200-day moving average (the green line) at 15,000 USD.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the Fed confirms the hawkish stance and sellers return to the markets, we might see a quick decline toward 14,500 USD, with a possible retest of the 14,000 USD threshold.</p>
<p>Either way, volatility is expected to be enormous after the decision, so investors should take a very cautious approach during and after this event.</p>
